Speaker 0    00:00:02    So your name is?
Speaker 1    00:00:04    Natalie Hazard Kaye.  
Speaker 0    00:00:06    And you were born?
Speaker 1    00:00:08    In <New York @40.823,-74.049,9> Mm-Hmm.  City in, um, October 16th, 1924. I say <New York @20.823,-74.049,9> Mm-Hmm. 
 
Speaker 0    00:00:17    That's a while ago.  
Speaker 0    00:00:18    A while ago. <laugh>. And when did you come to Middleburg?  
Speaker 1    00:00:23    When I was eight years old.  
Speaker 0    00:00:25    And why did you come? Why were you brought here?  
Speaker 1    00:00:27    Because my mother and father were getting a divorce and my mother had been down here to Fox Hunt, um, for several years before that and thought it was a wonderful place. Mm-Hmm.  and decided to move here with me. And of course, I had never been, I'd hardly ever met my mother before because <laugh>, I had a nurse that I adored. And when I was separated from my nurse, it was a disaster, but it worked out.  
Speaker 0    00:01:00    Do you have any siblings that came? No. No. So just the two of you came Uhhuh  That must have been a good adventure.  
Speaker 1    00:01:06    <laugh>. It really was. <laugh>. It was a scary adventure at first, but it turned out beautifully. Mm-Hmm,   
Speaker 0    00:01:12    And where did you move to in the area when you came?  
Speaker 1    00:01:15    When we first came, we were paying guests at Missy Saban.  
Speaker 0    00:01:19    And I don't know where that is, would you,  
Speaker 1    00:01:21    That's where, um, that's where Melissa Phipps and Birdie's <Place @38.985,-77.795,16> is now.  
Speaker 0    00:01:29    What road is that on?
Speaker 1    00:01:30    611  
Speaker 0    00:01:32    And you stayed there for a while?  
Speaker 1    00:01:36    We stayed there for I think a year or two, and then we moved into the house on Route 50 where Rufus Humphrey lived. Mm-Hmm.     
Speaker 1    00:01:48    And, uh, of course we, all we wanted to do was play with <horses https://assets.isu.pub/document-structure/240724150510-1949f1d917c8af019638d1188096147d/v1/fca7fbeb9f500bb09bead3d1cd6bed86.jpeg?width=2160&quality=85%2C50> and so there it was.  
Speaker 0    00:02:00    And you went to school here?
TOC     2    School 
Speaker 1    00:02:02    I went to the <Hill School https://www.thehillschool.org>.
Speaker 0    00:02:04    You did?  
Speaker 1    00:02:04    And, uh, I, when I went, when I first went there, there were 30 children in the school. And then it dropped down to my last year before I went to boarding school, there were 15 children in the school. Wow. And I was in a class of one.  
Speaker 0    00:02:21    You were the only child in your grade? Yes,  
Speaker 1    00:02:24    <laugh>. But when I got to boarding school, I was up with all my classmates.  
Speaker 0    00:02:30    So where did you go to off to boarding school?  
Speaker 1    00:02:32    <Miss Halls https://cdn.sanity.io/images/yln0jo77/production/244716c763850eb9a553d9b73e1e2d5b628d3977-1002x721.jpg?w=800&h=576&fit=crop>. Mm-Hmm.  in <Pittsfield, Mass @42.448,-73.255,14>. Right. And, uh, that was good. Made lifelong friends there. Right. And, uh, then came back here, of course, for vacations. Mm-Hmm.  
Speaker 1    00:02:50    And then eventually my mother remarried and we lived at <Stone Hedge @39.01592,-77.74400,16>, which is a farm near here. Mm-Hmm.  And, uh, well, we, we all had fun.
Speaker 0    00:03:11    Uh, who did your mother remarry?  
Speaker 1    00:03:14    Bill Hubbert. Mm-Hmm.  And I had five step brothers and sisters. Suddenly.  
Speaker 0    00:03:24    And you were already in high school by that point?  
Speaker 1    00:03:27    No. Well, wait a minute. Let me think. Um,    
Speaker 1    00:03:34    I guess, I guess I was when they, I can't remember whether I was or not when they first married. I think I was though.  
Speaker 0    00:03:46    So you were away at boarding school? Yeah. But you would come back in holidays and summers and, oh, yeah. Did you spend a lot of time in New York City?  
Speaker 1    00:03:54    Um, when I was very little I did, but not after that.  
Speaker 0    00:03:59    You didn't go back to  
Speaker 1    00:04:00    Oh yeah. We went back every year. Mm-Hmm.  But, 'cause I had a lot of relations there. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:04:06    Did you spend time with your dad there?  
Speaker 1    00:04:08    No, I wasn't allowed to do that. My father was an alcoholic and that was a problem.  
Speaker 0    00:04:16    So your mother had brought you down here and  
Speaker 1    00:04:19    Yeah. And, uh,  
TOC     2	 Fox hunting
Speaker 1    00:04:24    And it turned out beautifully down here when that, those first years, Missy Saban was very much of a child per, she didn't have any children of her own, but she was wonderful with children. Mm-Hmm.  later on, she looked after the Phipps children, but, um, she, we had a, that first winter we had lots of snow and Missy said, you know what's really funny is coasting on trays, and we'll take 10 trays out there and coast. Well, that was so nice of her, and it was so fun. Right. And, and, uh, you know, I had a pony right away and Mm-Hmm.  and, and a dog. And so it was nice.  
Speaker 0    00:05:13    And did you fox hunt when you were young?  
Speaker 1    00:05:17    Yes. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:05:19    Who did you hunt with?  
Speaker 1    00:05:21    We hunted at those first years with Piedmont. Mm-Hmm.  And then later on, um, with both Orange Caddy, all three hunts. Mm-Hmm.  really.  
Speaker 0    00:05:33    What was it like being in Middleburg when you were a child? What did you do?  
Speaker 1    00:05:38    Well, every day when you got home from school, you got on your pony, Uhhuh , and rode and, uh, played on the farm. And, you know, we, we had, we visited each other. Mm-Hmm.  Well, I mean, our, my classmates, because in those early years I had classmates. Right. Um, and we'd take, you know, we'd take turns going to each other's houses and, but it usually involved riding.  
Speaker 0    00:06:13    You would ride to your friend's house.  
Speaker 1    00:06:14    Yeah. Well, later on, after we moved to, to the next house, um, the McConnell's lived on the <Zula Road @38.91817,-77.78685,15> and Betty McConnell was my best friend. And every afternoon when we got home from school, we'd meet after lunch, we'd have lunch at home, and then we'd get on our ponies and we'd meet and we'd ride all afternoon.  
Speaker 0    00:06:38    That sounds like a wonderful way to grow  
Speaker 1    00:06:40    Up. It was fun. It really was.  
Speaker 0    00:06:43    And there were, um, the people whose property you went through, talk about how, uh, people would, I guess, just let you ride on any property you wanted to.  
Speaker 1    00:06:59    Oh, yes. Everybody knew each other. Mm-Hmm.  I mean, in those days it was such a tiny community, and they, and the, all the people from the north that had, that had moved here, had moved here for the hunting. And, uh, so it, you, you know, you, you went wherever you wanted to go and nobody expected you not to. So that was, that was all right. I mean, nobody, it, it never crossed anybody's mind, I don't think, to ask if they could go through. Well, 'cause it was taken for granted that she would. Right. And there were so few people. And the, the Route 50 was when we first came, route 50 was a dirt road. Was it from Middleburg? Not, not from Washington to Middleburg, but from Middleburg West. And then of course, very soon it got paved. Right. And the people that worked on the road were mostly, um, chain gangs. And they used to have, they used to have the prisoners all dressed up in stripes and, uh, and a gun at either end with a policeman. Different world.  
Speaker 0    00:08:23    Right. Just getting that done.  
Speaker 1    00:08:25    Yeah.
TOC     2    Town 
Speaker 0    00:08:27    Did you go into town a lot?  
Speaker 1    00:08:29    Not much, no. No.  
Speaker 0    00:08:33    What, what did you do in the town of Middleburg when you were younger?  
Speaker 1    00:08:39    You just did your shopping? I mean, the, there were just, there was a <hardware store https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRzOcH5S5Bh3ql_yz5HIt1wdWRDl0R8MMcg3g&s&.png> and a feed store and a drug store. And there were two <drug stores https://www.middleburglife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Photo_08-1.jpg>, as a matter of fact. Mm-Hmm.  and, um, a couple of grocery stores. And that was it. None of these boutiquey kind of places. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:09:04    Did you go to Washington at all?  
Speaker 1    00:09:06    No. Sometimes, but not often. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:09:09    Your life was pretty much centered out here around  
Speaker 1    00:09:12    Yeah, pretty much out here. We'd go in town. And the, and the thing was that you always met your family in front of the elevators, in the <Mayflower Hotel https://www.southernspiritguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/LOC-Mayflower-Hotel-after-completion-Harris-Ewing.jpg>.  
Speaker 0    00:09:22    Really? <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:09:23    That was the meeting, that was the meeting place. The Mayflower was the only decent hotel in Washington then. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:09:30    When you say your family, you mean you would've gone,  
Speaker 1    00:09:34    Well if you were, you turned loose, um, when you were a little, I was a little bit older then. Right then. And you were meeting your mother or stepfather or brothers or stepsisters, you'd always meet in front of the elevators at the Mayflower <laugh>.  
TOC     2    College

TOC     2    The war
Speaker 1    00:10:10    But I didn't, I didn't graduate. I, I didn't, I got married and I worked, actually it was during the war, so I worked down, um, as a nurse's, as a Red Cross nurse's aide first when I was, I guess 16, 17 in the, um, <Winchester Hospital https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSDXHFI7W2UcuL6pagMdn01dyzgK2hbZ1D_UA&s&.png>. Hmm. And then I went to, what is now the <Greenbrier https://storage.googleapis.com/hippostcard/p/db69d9c91d3ac0ed96ba674899a7d261-800.jpg> in <White Sulfer Springs @37.79581,-80.29358,12>, but was then <Ashford General Army Hospital https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQA4T-10jexwP6BXEpsa06kcMg8eVA8DJmr5A&s#.png>.  
Speaker 0    00:10:43    Really? I didn't realize that. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:10:46    And, and, uh, there were about a dozen of us. We were volunteers and they worked us hard and they, they housed us and they fed us. And, um, we worked the same hours as the nurses. Mm-Hmm.  eight hour days, eight hour shifts. And, and so I was there for a year, maybe a little over a year.  
Speaker 0    00:11:13    And what were your responsibilities there?  
Speaker 1    00:11:16    Well, you were looking after patients and doing, we did, we, we, we were taught to give penicillin shots, and then we gave back rubs and changed bed pans and, and did, you know, go for work. Mm-Hmm.  But they, they needed us because they were, they, you know, they nurses didn't have time to do everything.  
Speaker 0    00:11:43    Right. They were doing the acute care and you were  
Speaker 1    00:11:46    Yeah. Doing,  
Speaker 0    00:11:47    Were keeping people comfortable. Yeah. Who, who was, who were the patients?  
Speaker 1    00:11:53    They were army wounded, army, um, men.  
Speaker 0    00:12:01    And how, do you know how they were allocated to come to that exact hospital? Were  
Speaker 1    00:12:05    They I don't,  
Speaker 0    00:12:06    But people that were from the area, or Oh, no. All ar  
Speaker 1    00:12:10    Oh, no. From everywhere. It was, it was interesting. And it was, um, it was a neat experience actually. Hello. No. Over those horrible things.  
Speaker 0    00:12:26    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:12:32    Um, so  
Speaker 0    00:12:33    Go ahead.  
Speaker 1    00:12:35    That was the, the, there was a German, um, prisoner camp Right. Very close by. And they did, took care of the grounds and, and did some of the cooking. And they were mostly from the Africa Corps prisoners. And then the patients were all, for the most part, American soldiers. There were a few that were other, were other nationalities. And I don't know how come they were there, but they were, but they were fabulous boys. There were, there was one ward that had guys that had their spinal cord severed and they couldn't move. And you'd walk into that ward and honestly, they were absolutely amazing. They'd be laughing and joking with each other. And here are these young guys that were in such terrible shape, but they were just so brave. Mm-Hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:13:47    The people that they brought in, the German prisoners that, that they brought in. Do you, did you witness any of the interaction between them and the men that were there?  
Speaker 1    00:14:03    No, there wasn't any really. There, there wasn't any. No. They were, no, they were, they were, they worked, but they, nobody talked to them.  
Speaker 0    00:14:17    And was that enforced or was that just kind of,  
Speaker 1    00:14:22    I think, I think if you had, it would've been enforced, but nobody did so. Right. It was just the way it was. And  
Speaker 0    00:14:31    Why, why was that? Did you get the sense of the emotion behind that?  
Speaker 1    00:14:36    Well, it was just that they were, had been the enemy. They were perfectly nice looking boys. Right. But you just, um, didn't fraternize <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:14:54    And what do you, what year was that, that you were there?  
TOC     2    Dating 
Speaker 1    00:14:59    I guess that was, uh, in the 43 maybe. Mm-Hmm.  42 3, because I was married in 45  
Speaker 0    00:15:13    Mm-Hmm.  Then you went back to school after you were at the No. Then you didn't No.  
Speaker 1    00:15:23    Didn't  
Speaker 0    00:15:24    Came back here,  
Speaker 1    00:15:25    Got married and then Yes. And well, we were living first in New York and then in outside <Philadelphia @39.965,-75.162,11>. And then my husband got sick. He got tb and he had to be, um, separated from everybody in those days. They put people to bed for a year. Mm-Hmm.  And so we came back down here and he went to, into a place in Charlottesville, a TB place. And he was there for a year. Hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:16:03    Uh, and what was your husband's name?  
Speaker 1    00:16:05    Howard. Kaye.  
Speaker 0    00:16:08    And where did you meet him?  
Speaker 1    00:16:10    Here. His family lived here. Mm-Hmm.  His mother lived here.  
Speaker 0    00:16:14    And how had you met him?  
Speaker 1    00:16:16    I think at one of the many dances that you, we used to have in the, the dances in the old days we're in the elementary school house  
Speaker 0    00:16:27    Over here  
Speaker 1    00:16:28    On the way  
Speaker 0    00:16:29    To, on the way Yeah. Into town.  
Speaker 1    00:16:30    Yeah. And the, you know, all the hunt bulls and everything were in the air and the New Year's Eve parties, it was before the community center was built. Right. And so I guess I, I must have met him at one of those.  
Speaker 0    00:16:50    And had he been born here?  
Speaker 1    00:16:54    No, he was born in Boston. And he went to, he went to boarding school when he was seven and was in boarding school until he went to college. And then he went to Yale and graduated from that. And then he went in the Navy and then, uh, eventually came back here. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 1    00:17:18    And I was, his stepfather would trained race horses. And so I went to a dinner party one night when I was, I guess I was 17 or 18 or something. And I happened to, it was such a small community then you all ages would be at the same parties? Mm-Hmm.  And I sat next to his stepfather and he said, um, he said, all my half my exercise boys have gone into the Army and I need somebody to gallop horses. Why don't you come and gallop for me? And so I said, oh, I'd like to do that. And so I did. And Howard would be upstairs sleeping, 'cause we'd get there at 5:00 AM <laugh> and get, you know, two or three sets out. And then I go in for breakfast. And he eventually started coming down for breakfast, which was unusual. And I guess that's how we started.  
Speaker 0    00:18:24    And his, um, what was his stepfather's name?  
Speaker 1    00:18:29    Jack Skinner.  
Speaker 0    00:18:30    Jack Skinner. That's a name I've heard.  
Speaker 1    00:18:32    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:18:37    Did you do, um, anything with racing beyond Galloping? The horses?  
Speaker 1    00:18:43    No. No. I never rode, rode races. Mm-Hmm. , but no, but on Gallop. And, and that was really fun.  
Speaker 0    00:18:52    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:18:54    Like that.  
Speaker 0    00:18:56    Um, how many horses did they have there?  
Speaker 1    00:19:01    I guess about 20.  
TOC     2    Married 
Speaker 0    00:19:04    And what did your husband do when he came back from, uh, from college or from the Navy? I guess  
Speaker 1    00:19:11    From the war, really. He, well, he was still in the Navy when we were married. And then, um, he ended up running the training track here.  
Speaker 0    00:19:23    Oh, really?  
Speaker 1    00:19:26    For below the <Paul Mellon https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7b/Mellon_paul.jpg> then.  
Speaker 0    00:19:33    So he was in with the racing too?  
Speaker 1    00:19:36    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:19:36    Or just the manage  
Speaker 1    00:19:37    Management. But he, he never got on, I mean, once in a while he'd, if I was sick or something, he'd, um, exercise my hunter if needed to be, and he'd always get run away with. So <laugh> <laugh>, he didn't really like that very much.  
Speaker 0    00:19:55    Tell me about the, um, you've referenced all the dances and hunt balls, and can you talk a little bit about the society of Middleburg when you were, um,  
Speaker 1    00:20:07    Coming up? Well, it was, um, as I said, very small community. And the, the all ages would be at, I mean, from the age, from when you were old enough to go, um, to those dances, all ages would be there. And, uh, sometimes, apparently, usually I had gone home by the time this happened. Usually, um, there would be a fight at the end <laugh>. And, uh, that usually consisted of the Randolph family.  
Speaker 0    00:20:50    Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:20:50    Yeah. Dr. Randolph and his son, his two sons would get into altercations with people. And, uh, but they were, you know, they were otherwise fun. Lots of pink coats and, and everybody dressed to the teeth and Mm-Hmm.  all having a good time.  
Speaker 0    00:21:11    Would there be, uh, a live music? Oh yeah. Yeah. So they would have a band or something. Yeah. And they have refreshments.  
Speaker 1    00:21:20    You brought your own.  
Speaker 0    00:21:28    And why did the randolph's get  
Speaker 1    00:21:30    Well? They'd all get drink too much and, and then they'd get into an altercation. <laugh>,  
Speaker 0    00:21:36    Was there any theme to them or  
Speaker 1    00:21:39    <laugh>? I don't know. I don't know. But that's the way it was.  
Speaker 0    00:21:46    That's funny. That's funny. Was there a lot of, um, going around to other people's houses for dinners then as well? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:21:55    Yeah. And in those days, you dressed and unless the, whoever invited you said, don't dress you. Mm-Hmm. , everybody dressed when they went out for dinner here then.  
Speaker 0    00:22:10    And what would you wear?  
Speaker 1    00:22:12    You'd wear an evening dress and the men would wear black tie.  
Speaker 0    00:22:21    And where did you get those evening dresses?  
Speaker 1    00:22:26    At a store. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:22:28    But not here?  
Speaker 1    00:22:30    No. Usually from someplace in New York or wherever.  
Speaker 0    00:22:36    So would you go on shopping trips to get your things for the season or  
Speaker 1    00:22:40    You'd see something advertised and call up and, and ask them to send it to you?  
Speaker 0    00:22:45    Right. What were the styles of, of was? So it was a long dress.  
Speaker 1    00:22:52    Yeah. Then early days, you know, I really wore long dresses. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:22:56    And was it gloves and  
Speaker 1    00:22:59    Not, not necessarily gloves? Not like that. I mean, I think that some of the coming out parties, you wore gloves. Mm-Hmm.  But not,  
Speaker 0    00:23:09    But just to dinner parties, you would just wear  
Speaker 1    00:23:11    Just to later on dinner parties, you just dress.  
Speaker 0    00:23:15    That's so fun. I wish we still did that.  
Speaker 1    00:23:17    Yeah, it was fun. I, I don't think the men liked it so much, but <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:23:24    Well, they always had to wear the same thing. Yeah. But you got to play around with all sorts of  
Speaker 1    00:23:29    Yeah, it was fun,  
Speaker 0    00:23:30    Fun clothes. Um, um, were there a lot of people, um, your age at these different dinner parties? Or did you mostly feel like it was adults and,  
Speaker 1    00:23:44    Well, n not, there were a few Mm-Hmm.  But it was just, there weren't many of any, any age really, because it was such, such a small community. Right. And, uh, so, you know, the, there were, uh, uh, everybody knew each other. Mm-Hmm.  And when, when we first came, all the telephones, when I was eight, all the telephones were party lines. And there was an operator called Mrs. Yates who knew where everybody was at all times. So if you'd call up somebody to invite them for dinner, Mrs. Yates would say, oh, she's not home. She's at the sys <laugh>. And that, that was the way that was.  
Speaker 0    00:24:38    And where was Mrs. Yates?  
Speaker 1    00:24:40    I don't know where she was. <laugh>. I don't know where she was. She was somewhere, I guess in Middleburg. There must have been a place, but I don't remember that.  
Speaker 0    00:24:49    So if you were going somewhere else, you would tell her, I'm gonna be  
Speaker 1    00:24:53    Here. No, no. She just listened, I think. <laugh>. Oh no, you, I, she must  
Speaker 0    00:24:58    Have had a good memory. She'd just know if I invited you over for tea, she would remember that you were gonna be at my house.  
Speaker 1    00:25:04    <laugh>, I guess, kind of thing, I guess. But it was, you know, there were just so few people that,  
Speaker 0    00:25:12    Um, and most people lived on farms around the town. Mm-Hmm.  So there weren't as many houses in town at the time?  
Speaker 1    00:25:20    Oh, no. There were hardly any really. The people, the people that worked in the shops lived in the town. Mm-Hmm.  But otherwise, um, the, none of those houses in Ridgeview that are there now. Right. Were there.  
Speaker 0    00:25:38    Right. When your mother, um, did buy the property that you went to, how many acres was that?  
Speaker 1    00:25:46    Oh, she didn't, she married. Oh, she didn't.  
Speaker 0    00:25:49    Oh, that's when she married. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:25:51    And that was about 500 acres.  
Speaker 0    00:25:53    500 acres. And what did they do with that land?  
TOC     2    Stepfather
Speaker 1    00:25:56    Well, he, pappi my stepfather had, uh, several brood mares and other horses and sheep and cows and, uh, farmed it, like to maintain the animals. And, uh, so, you know, that's the way it was.  
Speaker 0    00:26:21    And was his primary job, uh, doing the animals or did he have another job?  
Speaker 1    00:26:27    He didn't, he never had a job of any sort Right. That I ever knew of <laugh>. But there were, there was a stable man and a, and a helper for him and, and a farmer and a helper for him. And a, and then there was, what was his name? There was a sort of a handyman that could fix anything on the farm. And my stepfather liked to like, how to shop. He liked to make things, and so the handyman could use all his tools if he needed to. And it just sort of worked.  
Speaker 0    00:27:10    And how much time did you spend, um, did you come back at holidays and summers and spend Yeah. Time there? Oh  
Speaker 1    00:27:20    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:27:24    Um, what was the house like there that you moved into?  
Speaker 1    00:27:31    It was, uh, just a house. I mean, it was a, it was a nice old house, but it was, uh, cold <laugh>. When people came for dinner, they'd bring their fur coats. Um, it had, well, there were five kids, so there were bedrooms for everybody. Mm-Hmm.  and, um, and one for me. And, um, there was a living room and a den and kitchen and, you know, normal house. Mm-Hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:28:06     And had that been a family house?  
Speaker 1    00:28:11    No, Pappy built, Pappy bought it before the war. And Mrs. Lee, who was a la uh, lady, that, um, she did a lot about horses, but she also managed farms. So he put the farm in her hands while he was gone. Mm-Hmm.  And, um, then when he came back, it just had a little, um, a little tiny couple of little tiny houses. He added the whole thing.  
Speaker 0    00:28:44    So the people that worked with him lived there on the farm? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:28:48    Yeah. They all had their own houses. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:28:50    Mm-Hmm.  And, um, what did he do in the war,  
Speaker 1    00:28:55    Do you know? He was in the American Field Service. Hmm. And he met his wife there, what to be, and she was the mother of the children. And then she died. And then about two or three years after she died, he and my mother were married. Mm-Hmm.  
Speaker 0    00:29:16    And had he grown up in Middleburg?  
Speaker 1    00:29:19    No, he came from <Cincinnati @39.096,-84.511,13>.  
Speaker 0    00:29:20    Cincinnati Uhhuh. And do you know why he came here?  
TOC     2    Hunting 
Speaker 1    00:29:23    To hunt?  
Speaker 0    00:29:24    To hunt? Mm-Hmm,  What, when you first started hunting, did you start right away when you were eight?  
Speaker 1    00:29:35    Oh, well, yeah, but I was, I had a pony on Long Island where we lived  
Speaker 0    00:29:40    Right  
Speaker 1    00:29:42    Before that. I mean, I'd ridden all my life.  
Speaker 0    00:29:45    Right. And what was the hunting like here early on? Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:29:50    Oh, it was wonderful. It, it was, I mean, everybody in those days rode thoroughbred horses, unlike today. And everybody really could ride in those days, unlike today. And, uh, it was, the fields were smaller and the hunting was wonderful. A lot of, a lot of the older ladies hunted, side saddle, side  
Speaker 0    00:30:29    Saddle.  
Speaker 1    00:30:32    And, uh, it was, it, it was just, you know, it was a honey community. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:30:40    So you would, but the, the basics still were that you went to different people's properties and went off from  
Speaker 1    00:30:49    Oh yeah. It was, you'd have different meats. Mm-Hmm.  and different places. Just the way you do today.  
Speaker 0    00:30:55    Right. And how many, when you say the field was smaller, how many on a given day?  
Speaker 1    00:31:03    Well, I would say a big field would probably be about 30 people. Mm-Hmm.  And usually, I mean, a lot of times it would be 12.  
Speaker 0    00:31:20    Has the, how do you think the hunting has changed here over the years?  
Speaker 1    00:31:26    Well, the, there are many more people hunting, but many of them, uh, now they have two or three different fields so that people that can't keep up can go out. Mm-Hmm.  And I guess maybe that's a good thing. 'cause there are so many people, but, and it keeps the hunts alive because they all pay full subscriptions. Right. So, 'cause it's expensive to maintain a hunt. And so I guess it's a good thing, but it's not quite the way it was. Mm-Hmm. , because we didn't have all those people that couldn't keep up.  
Speaker 0    00:32:12    You just went. Yeah. And who kept up? So it was still a subscription though, that people would pay. Oh yeah. And to keep the kennels and the hounds and the Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:32:24    People. But for many years the subscription was $300, and now I think it's about 3000.  
Speaker 0    00:32:31    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:32:33    So it's changed a bit in that respect. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:32:36    Mm-Hmm.  Was there a,  
Speaker 1    00:32:40    Do you hunt?  
Speaker 0    00:32:41    No.  
Speaker 1    00:32:42    Oh, okay.  
Speaker 0    00:32:44    Um, I haven't had a horse for some time when I moved here I did. And then we moved overseas for some time. Oh, you did? And, um, I actually had gave my horse to my farrier's wife, Uhhuh, and, 'cause he had some foot problems and I had gotten him to hunt, and then just, he was just never fit enough and I didn't think that was fair. So, um,  
Speaker 1    00:33:08    So  
Speaker 0    00:33:09    You did, in hindsight, I probably shouldn't have been attached to him. I should have probably just started over, but, you know. Yeah. I guess you always think you'll have another chance and I still will have another chance. But Yeah. Then I had kids and since I hadn't been doing it my whole life, I thought, well, it probably isn't the best time to start when you have babies, <laugh>. Exactly.  
Speaker 1    00:33:30    No, that's true. Because you can't be spared then, right.  
Speaker 0    00:33:35    <laugh>. Right. So  
Speaker 1    00:33:36    If something happens,  
Speaker 0    00:33:37    My grandfather, um, raised Morgan horses Oh, really? In Indiana. Uhhuh  And so my mother had grown up, uh, on a farm, and we all grew up riding, but there wasn't fox hunting there. No. So, you know, there was plenty of land to ride really fast, but it wasn't organized the way, you know, we would just go out, you know, my cousins and I would just go  
Speaker 1    00:34:03    Out and have fun. Right. Yeah. Oh, great. So  
Speaker 0    00:34:06    It wasn't organized like this. So I was, when I moved here, which was about 20 years ago, I was very keen to try it. And, uh, it just hasn't, it hasn't happened.

Speaker 1    00:34:30    Oh, right. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:34:31    Big piece there. Oh yeah. That, there used to be a lot of hunting there, but I think it's not, the footing's not been, the field's not been kept up, so.  
Speaker 1    00:34:40    Oh, right.  
Speaker 0    00:34:41    Um, I've heard from several people that they don't go in there anymore because  
Speaker 1    00:34:46    I think that was Kathy Mellon's.  
Speaker 0    00:34:48    Yeah, it was,  
Speaker 1    00:34:50    Uh, you don't really want to go out, but I'll let you out in case.   
Speaker 1    00:35:12    Does your husband commute into Washington?  
Speaker 0    00:35:14    No, he doesn't. Um, he commutes to wherever his job is, he's a consultant for companies that have telecommunications companies. Oh. So he goes when he is needed to his clients, and otherwise he works at home. That's  
Speaker 1    00:35:34    Perfect.  
Speaker 0    00:35:34    Yeah. And I'm a writer, so I can work at home. Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:35:37    That's perfect.  
Speaker 0    00:35:38    So we have quite a nice life here. Yeah. That's great. You know, he had moved here for a job 30 years ago, and then he was divorced and we got married. And so he had two kids when I, I got the package deal.  
Speaker 1    00:35:53    And how old were they?  
Speaker 0    00:35:54    They were six and nine. Oh, wow. And now they're 26 and 29.  
Speaker 1    00:35:59    Oh, wow. Good for you. You did a good job with them. Well,  
Speaker 0    00:36:03    They're still alive. <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:36:06    Oh, wow.  
Speaker 0    00:36:07    That's a low bar. But I think it's a good one.  
Speaker 1    00:36:09    <laugh>. Oh, that's great.  
Speaker 0    00:36:12    So how do you, um, I'm sure that you meet people that haven't been Fox hunting before. How do you describe it to people?  
Speaker 1    00:36:23    Well, I don't think you ever do. I mean, if they're not interested, you don't talk about it. Mm-Hmm.  Uh, and if they are interested, they usually wanna try it. Right. So I don't, I I can't remember ever trying to describe it to somebody that Right. It's sort of something that we all grew up with, so.  
Speaker 0    00:36:52    Right. I, I think that there'll be a lot of interest in Fox hunting in the museum. I think that there'll be a lot of people come that, um, you know, that was an organizing principle of Middleburg.  
Speaker 1    00:37:12    Yeah. Oh, definitely. The  
Speaker 0    00:37:14    Fox hunting the people that came. It sounds like the people that you socialized with and were classmates with that their families, um,  
Speaker 1    00:37:24    They all came in The  
Speaker 0    00:37:25    Main had come for that.  
Speaker 1    00:37:26    Yeah. They had,  
Speaker 0    00:37:29    And had they been here for generations? Or when, when did that, so that's pretty much started in the  
Speaker 1    00:37:38    Twenties, I think In  
Speaker 0    00:37:39    The twenties,  
Speaker 1    00:37:41    Probably the, in the, yeah. Probably in the late twenties and, and then grew from there. But a lot of, a lot of people came from the New York area. Mm-Hmm.  And, and then some from Chicago and some from other places.  
Speaker 0    00:38:09    And why here?  
Speaker 1    00:38:11    'cause the hunting is, this is the best hunting in the country. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:38:15    What makes it so  
Speaker 1    00:38:17    The, the countryside, I think. And the fact that, um, they've bred good packs of pounds and there are, there are mixed packs and American packs and English packs all around. And, uh, it's just been, it's just sort of a natural,  
Speaker 0    00:38:47    Were there as many different hunts when you first came? Mm-Hmm.  Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:38:53    More actually, because there were the cobbler, which are no longer in existence.  
Speaker 0    00:38:57    Where were they?  
Speaker 1    00:38:58    They were south of Warrenton. Mm-Hmm.  Well, I mean west of Warrenton, I, I should say not south west of Warrenton. Um, but otherwise the, the same number.  
Speaker 0    00:39:15    So it was, there's Piedmont Middleburg, Orange,  
Speaker 1    00:39:19    Orange County County, orange and Old Dominion.  
Speaker 0    00:39:22    Blue Ridge.  
Speaker 1    00:39:23    Blue Ridge,  
Speaker 0    00:39:24    Snickers.  
Speaker 1    00:39:26    Well, SnickersVille is new.  
Speaker 0    00:39:27    Oh it is? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:39:29    But, uh, that evolved just from a, from a war between the Middleburg Hunt and, and uh, dot Smith <laugh>. And so they started their own hunt on her property. 'cause she has, she had several thousand acres.  
Speaker 0    00:39:50    What was the contention?  
Speaker 1    00:39:54    I can't remember <laugh>. But there was some contention and she closed her land to the Middleburg Hunt. And so there it was.  
Speaker 0    00:40:10    So people had to choose.  
Speaker 1    00:40:12    Well, so then Greg Ryan sort of started the SnickersVille.  
Speaker 0    00:40:25    The one time I did go out, I went out with SnickersVille because I was trying the horse. Oh, did you there because it seems to me that they thought it was an easier pack to start out with. Easier to ride,  
Speaker 1    00:40:39    Maybe. Yeah. Well, I think it is probably Mm-Hmm.  because there isn't so much to jump right  
Speaker 0    00:40:46    There. Terrain's a little.  
Speaker 1    00:40:47    Yeah. Um, but years ago, the, the, a bunch of Maryland people, we had a joint meet with, um, green Spring Valley in Maryland. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    00:40:58    Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 1    00:40:59    And they said down their noses at us, they said, I don't see how you make hunters in Virginia. You don't have anything to jump. And so they invited us back. The, this was a middleburg hunt. And I think eight of us went and we knew they were gonna try and kill us. And they did try and kill us. And at the end of the day, every middleburg person was there. And the only Maryland person that was left was on, was the master who was on his second horse <laugh>. So our, our hunters knew how to jump.  
Speaker 0    00:41:37    'cause And your riders knew how to handle 'em  
Speaker 1    00:41:40    Well, they tried to make us up all those great big Maryland fences. Right. And, uh, our horses managed to do it.   
Speaker 0    00:41:53    Did you, um, did you have much to do with the Hill School when you came back? Did you, did you have children? Yeah,  
Speaker 1    00:42:07    I have three boys. You have three boys. And they all went

Speaker 1    00:44:22    Grown. Everything had grown. Yeah. And there were more kids. Mm-Hmm. , which was good for the kids. Right. And we used to, you know, we used to have skating parties. We'd had ice sometime quite, quite often on ponds. And we'd have skating parties with the kids. And, um, we had pony club that they all did. And, um, I don't know, we seemed to entertain them. Mm-Hmm.        
Speaker 1    00:44:56    And they'd come, some, they'd come and spend the night at our house or we'd go and our kids, one of our kids would go and spend the night with a friend. And there it was.

Speaker 1    00:45:11    We lived at the, if you, you come in our driveway, if you look to the left, there's a house. Right. We lived in that house. Mm-Hmm.  for 25 years, I think.  
Speaker 0    00:45:26    And so you had brought, you bought this property? Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 1    00:45:31    And built this house  
Speaker 0    00:45:32    And built this house, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:45:34    50 years ago. Hmm. <laugh>. So,  
Speaker 0    00:45:39    And that house had been there. So when you Oh yeah. When you,  
Speaker 1    00:45:42    Well, what it belonged to the wards who were friends of ours, and he was the master of the Middleburg Hounds. And, um, he, he said he, we were looking for a house to do something with. And he said, well, it has eight people living in it right now. And, um, I, and they keep throwing their overalls in my spring, so I would like to get rid of it. So he sold it to us for $2,000 <laugh>. And then it had a dirt floor at the back and, and no water and no or no electricity or anything, but we did it up.  
Speaker 0    00:46:22    It's a beautiful house.  
Speaker 1    00:46:24    And so that was kind of fun doing. And Victor DuPont was then in the building business and he did it. And he, he was, he did such a good job.

Speaker 0    00:46:47    It was just an acre. Yeah. And then when did you get this?  
Speaker 1    00:46:50    We got this, um, well, I guess a little over 50 years ago. Mm-Hmm. , because we, we built the house.  
Speaker 0    00:46:58    So is it contiguous land to that? No,

And he, he waited for two years. He got offer after offer after offer. And he was like this. And he wouldn't make up his mind who was gonna get it. And then he finally gave it to us. I mean, didn't give it to us, but sold it to us. Right. But it took him two years to make up his mind.  
Speaker 0    00:48:15    And who was Mr. Fred  
Speaker 1    00:48:17    Dot Smith's father? Mm-Hmm.  And he owned all those, I mean, thousands of acres

Speaker 1    01:05:24    To serve? He was, no, he was in, um, from college on, he enlisted in. Right. They had a program in those days in Mm-Hmm. , all the colleges where you could take some kind of something that you went into the service right out of school. And they were sent, and then he was sent to someplace outside Chicago, I think, for original enlistment and getting started. Right. And he was sent to various different ships all through the war.  
Speaker 0    01:06:03    And why did he choose the Navy?  
Speaker 1    01:06:08    Beats me. <laugh>, I guess. I guess because he liked the idea, I guess. Right. Rather than the Army. But they were given a commission right away.  
Speaker 0    01:06:20    Right. So that would've been When, when was he at Yale?  
Speaker 1    01:06:27    He graduated in 41, I think.  
Speaker 0    01:06:31    So then he went right into the,  
Speaker 1    01:06:34    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:06:37    So then his, um, what was he doing when you lived in New York? He was in,  
Speaker 1    01:06:43    He, he worked for previews for a while and then he worked for company, the bo to his uncle that was, did something, had something to do with railroad trains. Mm-Hmm.  And then he went, um, into the Mead Corporation, which was a paper company. Right. And they were headquarters in Philadelphia. So we, that's when we moved down there.  
Speaker 0    01:07:09    And when you came back here, it was when he had tv? Mm-Hmm.  So you came back here for him to recuperate? Mm-Hmm.  And then just stayed after that?  
Speaker 1    01:07:18    Well, yeah, basically. Mm-Hmm.  That was it. But in those days it was, they were really kept people in bed. And when he, when he first, when we were in Danbury, which is outside Philadelphia, we were living in a tenant house of a friend of his renting it. And, uh, all the sheets and towels and plates and for knives and forks, everything had to be boiled.  
Speaker 0    01:07:50    Right.  
Speaker 1    01:07:53    So we were, and you, you know, it was, it was sort of a tough time for a while.  
TOC     2    Tuberculosis
Speaker 0    01:08:01    Mm-Hmm.  Right. I bet it was. How does, how did he contract tuberculosis?  
Speaker 1    01:08:08    I think that maybe it was when that kamikaze hit the ship. Really, they were trapped below for a long time, but they never really knew that, that was just a thought, a thought that might, might have caused it.  
Speaker 0    01:08:24    So that was quite a long incubation period then  
Speaker 1    01:08:29    He'd never been tested before. Right. That it was just a routine test that his company did. The meat corporation, I guess did. And that's when they discovered it.  
Speaker 0    01:08:41    But until he had the test for it, he didn't have any symptoms of it.  
Speaker 1    01:08:46    Well, you know, tb, you don't really have symptoms much.  
Speaker 0    01:08:50    I don't know much about it. Sorry.  
Speaker 1    01:08:51    It's, it's, uh, I guess sometimes you do, but in his case, he, he hadn't.  
Speaker 0    01:09:00    Wow.  
Speaker 1    01:09:01    So it could have been there for quite a while. You don't know.  
Speaker 0    01:09:07    So did he ever have symptoms from it?  
Speaker 1    01:09:11    Well, he, they, you know, they'd take x-rays of your lungs and everything. And, and then they, the symptoms were revealed. But he, he was, he'd get tired and he'd have to rest a lot. Mm-Hmm.    
Speaker 0    01:09:30    And when you came back to Middleburg and he, did he go right to the track then?  
Speaker 1    01:09:35    No, then he went back to, then he was in that place in Charlottesville  
Speaker 0    01:09:39    For Right. But when he, when he was done with that, when he was better,  
Speaker 1    01:09:42    Um, uh, not right away. 'cause he still had to rest a lot of the day. Right. And then he did after, after that, that got  
Speaker 0    01:09:55    Better. Was it relatively easy to find a job in Middleburg?  
TOC     2    Paul Mellon
Speaker 1    01:10:00    No, I don't think so. But it just happened that a Jack Skinner was training for his stepfather was training for Paul Mellon and his mother told Paul Mellon that he needed a job. And so he gave him the training track to run. Mm-Hmm.   
Speaker 0    01:10:23    So he worked for Paul Mellon?  
Speaker 1    01:10:26    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:10:30    What kind of a guy was he? Paul Mellon.  
Speaker 1    01:10:32    Oh. He was an awfully nice man.  
Speaker 0    01:10:34    Was he?  
Speaker 1    01:10:35    Yeah. Awfully nice, man.  
Speaker 0    01:10:48    They must have had some nice parties there.  
Speaker 1    01:10:51    Well, they did, but they were, he was pretty low key. Mm-Hmm.  He didn't, they didn't entertain lavishly at all. Mm-Hmm.  Just very simple things. I used to go there for lunch with Bunny sometimes when my oldest was little and take him. Um, but, you know, all very small and simple.  
Speaker 0    01:11:16    Right. And keeping with where they lived. I think that's why they like to live here. Mm-Hmm.  probably. Mm-Hmm. Well, thank you so much for letting me come visit with you.  
Speaker 1    01:11:38    Well, I'm sorry I can't offer you anything. Is it, would you like a little bite of lunch or anything?  
Speaker 0    01:11:43    Um, I, yes, I would love to. How about a cup of coffee? Yeah, sure. Would that be all right?  
Speaker 1    01:11:53    Absolutely.
