Speaker 0    00:00:02    So could you state your name  
Speaker 1    00:00:04    And Shelby Hatcher? James L Hatcher Jr. I'm from, originally from Richmond, Virginia. I was born in 1935, which means I'm 84. Anyway, uh, I first rode at <Upperville https://www.upperville.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Charlie-Weaver-Stocking-Stuffer-940x675.png> in 1949, and then in 1951 I came up here and rode. That was the first Loudoun horse show. It was the Loudoun Junior Show at <Glenwood Park https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/loudounnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/23/623f33fa-92d4-11ef-b1ab-a32c62b4a24b/671b9c474177c.image.jpg?resize=400%2C266>. And I was champion and we stayed, daddy and I sayed at this place down, not the Red Fox, but this, this one,  
Speaker 0    00:00:49    It's called the <Colonial Inn https://www.cardcow.com/images/set237/card00557_fr.jpg> 
Speaker 1    00:00:50    Colonial Inn, yeah, it was. And then I came back later on with a friend and helped him at Upperville. I don't know why I didn't bring my horse, but anyway, and, uh, then we went to the movies in the <movie theater https://www.middleburglife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Middleburg-Hollywood-Theater-Burning-in-1941-794x1024.gif> that was beside the Red Fox. And then I room with the Jim Wily at Hamden Sydney College in 1953 through 57. And came up here a lot then. And then in 1966, I came up here to run <Spur Magazine https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/XvUAAOSwvMJg0hwO/s-l400.jpg> and that didn't work. So <Phil Thomas https://www.thomasandtalbot.com/Image/Company/CompanyT.jpg>, an old friend, said, why don't you get your real estate license? And so I'd already rented my house in Richmond. So I stayed, I had my horse up here and I stayed, kept my horse with Ms. Randolph with Salem Stable and hunting with Piedmont, uh, two or three years. And then, let's see, and I seemed to get more horses and I moved them to then was Colony Farm. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Which is now Paper Chase or state what they call it. You know, they call it Fox Chase, right?  
Speaker 0    00:02:27    Yeah. It was <Paper Chase https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRGr9eOK-Vu_2x6btlWyy4N8aHnj6uvMXo8IA&s#.jpg>. Now  
Speaker 1    00:02:29    It's Fox Chase. Yeah. And I was there for a couple of years and I don't know what, what else? 
Speaker 0    00:02:37    When you were first coming to to Upperville, what were you jumping?  
Speaker 1    00:02:43    Oh yeah, yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:02:45    So your profession is a  
Speaker 1    00:02:46    I was 14. Yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:02:47    You were 14. Yeah. And your, did your family breed horses or  
Speaker 1    00:02:52    No. No, but my, I had an older cousin who rode and I won a blue ribbon at camp and they leased me a horse, a pony. And after a year of that, when they bought me a pony, and then I was hooked and eventually I sold pony was champion at the Warrenton Pony Show in 1949, and then I bought, uh, that, yeah, I also fractured my skull, but I'd already bought a 2-year-old and he was a star. He sort of grew with me. Were you horsey? And, let's see. I went to <BHSA https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0W-OsqnuCewiwAAx-FV1KCLLwddcejdvvqQ&s#.jpg> in 49 and then couldn't go to New York that year 'cause the fractured skull. But I was seventh in the McLay and then I was second in the McLay. And, let's see, 1950. I was seventh in 51. I was second.  
Speaker 1    00:04:02    And that same horse when he was three, uh, qualified me to go train with the Olympic team. I was the first Olympic civilian Olympic team, and they were going to train at <Indiantown Gap @40.4070233,-76.585326,11.59>. But, uh, since I just fractured my skull that year, parents didn't think it was wise for me to leave school and go. So I sort of missed that opportunity. Okay. It is pity. But then I think maybe they wanted the horse not big anywhere. <laugh>, he was a starch Rio. The tryouts were the Warrenton show grounds, and uh, they just had grass footing them and it rained all day long. And tryouts were at night under lights of four feet and a figure eight course with an ox. I never jumped an ER before four feet. And, uh, he was a star. He slipped after the second, second fence was a, a stone wall in the station stone wall. And his feet went out from my memory, and he got up and finished the course and my daddy gave me such a hug. <laugh>. Yeah, I did have a sort of a friendly judge who knew, knew I'd wanted to BHSA. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He helped me a little bit, so, so you had an amazing career. Early. Early. And then I did things like go to college, kept a horse to college and showed, but, you know, and, uh, showed ion and um, and had some blood, got to New York, you know, and, uh, when you had to qualify to go and, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:06:08    What's the show in New York?  
Speaker 1    00:06:10    <Madison Square Garden https://oldprintshop.com/uploads/jpg/68557.jpg>. It was a national horse show.  
Speaker 0    00:06:13    Wow.  
Speaker 1    00:06:15    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:06:17    What was that like?  
Speaker 1    00:06:19    Well, it was over my head, but anyway, I got a ribbon in the hack <laugh>, I got a callback or two, got a ribbon in the hack. Didn't get a ribbon. But anyway, that was fun. That's  
Speaker 0    00:06:35    Very fun.  
Speaker 1    00:06:35    Yeah. But it's a horse. I got, I galloped at the training center year and uh, it was a horse I'd gotten for a thousand dollars off the training center. I trained it.  
Speaker 0    00:06:48    Was it a, a young horse then? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:06:52    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she wound up on the, uh, Mexican team jumping team. She was never really tight with her knees, you know, took way up in the air. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:07:02    <affirmative>. How has the show circuit changed since those times?  
Speaker 1    00:07:12    Much more expensive. Yeah. Very expensive.  
Speaker 0    00:07:15    That's interesting. So yeah, regular old people could get in it if they Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:07:21    Persevered. Yeah. You know, I could buy always a thousand dollars and, and go to local shows and you see, and Virginia judges usually judge New York judge the big shows. And so they would see at the, you know, I'd go Virginia State <Upperville https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQDdxy-nUR1NRxj-7lWDBx_ChOT5WujmbExLg&s#.jpg>, where the big shows, but there were a lot of little shows, those place. And you'd get on a judge's good list  
Speaker 0    00:07:51    And he'd never look  
Speaker 1    00:07:52    At you and, and he would know you when you saw you like, at Harrisburg or something like that, you know.  
Speaker 0    00:08:01    And what was the status of Upperville a amongst the shows at that time?  
Speaker 1    00:08:08    It's always been big. Yeah. Yeah. Always been. But we didn't come up from Richmond much though.  
Speaker 0    00:08:18    Why was that?  
Speaker 1    00:08:19    I dunno. They had their own sort of sets of judges and it was a sort of closed group. And, uh, Berryville had the Beville fairgrounds, they had a, a show, and it was the same thing there. I made the mistake of going there for one day and realizing the green confirmation division was 60% confirmation, 40% form performance. And I, I remember Dot Smither said, did you read the, the prize list? And anyway, let's, let's see. Dot got me a ride. Dot Smither was a friend. She got me a ride at, uh, Berryville. I just came in my jeans to see that another year. And that turned out to be a really cute voice. I believe a friend of mine bought it. And, but I showed him most of the form. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:09:30    Was that when, uh, who had the training track at the time?  
Speaker 1    00:09:35    Well, when I got off the train, I got the Sydney waters and Paul f  
Speaker 0    00:09:42    So that was after the consortium had  
Speaker 1    00:09:45    Gone, this was a long time ago. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I was sitting across the table from Bill Perry's went night, and, uh, Sydney Waters said I would never learn anything going around a showroom. And I said, well, I'd like to gallop. And he said, well, come Monday. And he'd forgotten, of course. But I was, I gallop for him for two years and it was learning experience.  
Speaker 0    00:10:12    And he was a trainer?  
Speaker 1    00:10:15    Trainer, yeah. Local  
Speaker 0    00:10:16    Trainer here. Yeah. And his horses were was regional or went all over?  
Speaker 1    00:10:22    Yeah, went all over, uh, Sidney Ward's, uh, big custom big horse with the Steve Clocks that owned Boxwood. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Jane Clark is still with us. You know, Jane Clark, very big with a hsa. She was head of a HSA one time. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Anyway. And they had a horse called Voice the Flag, who was 2-year-old champion of the United States. And, and he broke his hind leg a week before the Derby. He was the favor for the Derby, and they kept him his top si. Uh, it was a si and there's a pen here, uh, right across from Hill School Road, that Hill School that, uh, Steve Clark would bring, uh, voice the flag back, uh, after the derby, after the, I guess after the Belmont Steak and turn him out and keep him at home. And, uh, I think he was not gonna have a fall season. And, uh, fortunately he went to Stud because he broke his leg and he never, the round pin is still there. It's very high, you know, like eight feet high with the wall sl at like that, still on the bell plane.  
Speaker 0    00:11:52    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:11:53    I mean, on the Middleburg <Plains Road @38.96443,-77.73825,16>
Speaker 0    00:11:55    Road. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I know where you mean. Yeah. Um, tell me about coming into the Horse Society then. You knew a lot of people by being around the shows and Yeah. By the time you got to Middleburg, and of course the Wiley's are  
Speaker 1    00:12:17    Very social. Well, big Jim Wiley was a top show judge, and they had their own group and which included the FALs Eve Fal was a great friend. I'd fallen in love with her at the Deep Run Horse Show. Uh, she had a top confirmation horse who was Champion. And at, at the Deep Run Horse Show, this is before Stipulations were so governed by the A HSA, you could show as a junior and deep run until you were 21, because you could be a junior member of the Deep Run Hunt Club until you were 21. And he even brought her pony to show him the junior division. And there's a picture I've got in my scrapbook of us standing side by side. I was 13 and I was riding my cousin. He developed a hernia, so they gave me my cousin's horse and I gave it back to him and <laugh>. Anyway, uh, but that's how I met Eve and fell mad in love with Eve felt. And that night mother, there was a party at the Hunt Club and mother came to pick me up and I said, wait a minute, I've gotta tell somebody goodbye. And I went, and then Eve looked like Debbie Reynolds when she was little, and there were college boys all around. And I waited through the college boys and said, come and tell you goodbye.  
Speaker 1    00:13:42    And we were friends, you know, she got taken away from us too soon.  
Speaker 0    00:13:51    She was a very special woman.  
Speaker 1    00:13:52    Yeah. She did a lot for the land of Millburn, I mean, for PEC. And she was a driving force, PEC,  
Speaker 0    00:14:05    So kind also. Yeah. Yes. Um, when you started to then be a, become a real estate agent, was there seemed to be a lot of real estate agents in town today.  
Speaker 1    00:14:23    Yeah. There, there weren't that many that there weren't that many. Uh, <Phil Thomas https://www.thomasandtalbot.com/Image/Company/CompanyT.jpg> had taken his license from his father, and I was the only other salesman, and then it got bigger. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:14:37    What was the market like when  
Speaker 1    00:14:41    You started? It was so wonderful, uh, that everybody had the same lawyer and you show a piece of property and then the check would arrive. I mean, do you know real estate at all? Well, you go to a settlement and you have to sign 20 things that you free of this fear of that, whatever. I was just mad Anyway, so when I inherited a little money, I gave it up  
Speaker 0    00:15:13    <laugh>. And, um, who else did you ride with that? A fun way to meet people?  
Speaker 1    00:15:24    Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:15:26    Well,  
Speaker 1    00:15:27    Uh, professionally, I, I had always with Bucky Reynolds and mostly I just sort of showed them on my own and, and I judged a lot.  
Speaker 0    00:15:42    That's interesting. When did you start doing that?  
Speaker 1    00:15:46    I started doing that. I was very interested. 1966, I got my Big R and the Judge Deron Jr. With George Morris. And it was his first a show too, really? And the judge with an old crook named Christopher Wadsworth, who had, uh, 40 horses that come down from car, oh, not Carl, I can't remember the name of the professional, but they were, Chris Wadsworth was in his pocket and very interesting learning experience for George and I. Yeah, yeah. He would say something he knew who could beat the horse he was pulling for, and he'd make a derogatory remark them, and they'd come in the ring and he'd say, make a good statement about the horse he was pulling for. And we learned a lot.  
Speaker 0    00:16:50    Was there a lot of that?  
Speaker 1    00:16:53    Not so much. Not so much. But he, he was the famous one. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And Bobby Burke was another professional that used him lot. And I know that, 'cause the girl I was going with wrote, wrote for Bobby Burke and wrote the checks. This doesn't have to be Fred <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:17:20    Um, everyone that I talked to, it just sounds like Middleburg was so much fun. It was in the,  
Speaker 1    00:17:33    Well, everybody was sort of interested in everything. I mean, you went to everybody's, everything. You know, the show horse show people went to the pointed points and that other thing thing. And there was a lot of overlapping families. You know, I had people that showed and hunted and rode and races like the fowls. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Joe. Well, Dougie was a, you know, top jockey and Nina was on the Olympic team. So it was interesting.  
Speaker 0    00:18:15    Yeah, that is interesting. Uh, one thing that I had heard is that you rode with <Pamela Harriman https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20241019_CUP004.jpg>.  
Speaker 1    00:18:23    Well, uh, I was leasing the stable Heidi. I was trying to, I rose an amateur, but I rode my horses off. And you had to make a tax. You used it two outta seven years, and they reduced it to two outta five years. So I had a year to, I was judging a lot, so I had income, but they, it had to look really good to be able to do that. So, uh, a friend owned the place, the Harriman's board, and uh, I met them, Evelyn, Pamela and I met the secretary and I had to get out, had to get my horses. And, uh, I never sold any horses when I should have, you know, they were winning and people wanted them. So, uh, I found homes for almost all of 'em. I sold one. And, uh, I called the secretary and said, Ms. Harriman liked me to show her the trails.  
Speaker 1    00:19:28    She just had two pleasures. And, uh, she's the secretary said, yeah, she was lost for three hours on the piece of land that she laid her bought, which is now salamander. And said she was lost for three hours and missed a luncheon she was given. And yeah. And she was really shook. I know she'd love you to show, but so we started just, she did wasn't, she hadn't jumped since 1938, but her father was a master Fox towns, and she jumped a lot. She was raised a country girl, uh, until she made her debut. And that's when the war started in England. And she married Winston Churchill's son and produced Young Winston. Her, her son's name was Winston. Anyway, she hadn't jumped since 1938. And we started her jumping and she was showing in hunter trials. And uh, and Graham was really fr they got back from Barbados and we rode over to <Foxcroft https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto,t_image_size_2/v1716487396/foxcroftorg/g3w7mqa1n3atz0xpt15x/wSummerSchoolhouse.jpg>.  
Speaker 1    00:20:32    They were having a little jumper show and all the event people were there and place was jammed with horses. And she had this needle map with one quarter fell pony, three quarters thoroughbred. And she had a stride on her, like a horse, but she was under 15 hands. And, uh, it was a jumper class. And she said, that doesn't look too difficult. And I said, it's not too difficult. She said, I said then, and now it's a little long, if she wants to jump in, then take two strides. You know, just let her do that and be prepared for that. She might wanna do that. And, uh, she was clean and there was a jump off, and I wouldn't, and when you went somewhere with the people like to come up and talk to you. And so I was busy talking to people and all of a sudden I heard a familiar number and I looked and she was in the ring for the jump off, and she didn't take two strides in the jump off, I'll tell you that. She was third and going home, she still had her ribbon. And we were riding down the hill hacking home. And she said, Jimmy, I just wanted to tell you, I never thought I'd be doing this again. And this has just meant so much to me because IL was, uh, he was wonderful to her, but he was seriously old and, uh, ho of hearing and hated his hearing aids and made life difficult.  
Speaker 1    00:22:06    Anyway, so we had a good time. And she, she took, took the field a couple of times from little bird hunting and yeah, we had a good time. Did she? And I was going to, I left. She was, she was, when she started working for C Clinton, she wasn't gonna hunt anymore and she wouldn't have obviously show anymore. And so, um, I went back into real estate and the girl been grooming for us, could ride really well. And so she rode with Pamela and Pamela went to France, you know, was in BA and uh, I was gonna ride with her when she, I had my horse over there waiting for her to come home. And she didn't come home. It was miss mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah. We had a good time 10 years.  
Speaker 0    00:23:01    She, uh, got hooked then again on showing after having the success.  
Speaker 1    00:23:08    Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, I got, uh, Katie Monahan to ride for us some. And Katie, she had the, uh, jumper top jump in the country twice, two years. Yeah. But Katie, yeah. So  
Speaker 0    00:23:38    The, um, seems to me when people talk about Middleburg also, there was a lot going on, like things that people did every night, going to the movies on Fridays and um, had a lot of dinner parties and music and things.  
Speaker 1    00:23:54    A lot of dinner parties. Yeah. You saw one every,  
Speaker 0    00:24:00    You did.  
Speaker 1    00:24:04    Well, I was a bachelor. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And made it easy. I think I was <inaudible>.  
Speaker 0    00:24:13    Was it all people your age or?  
Speaker 1    00:24:15    No, that was a wonderful thing about Little Bird when we, when I came up here with Jim Wily, uh, the Pies who always mixed group. Mixed ages, which wasn't that way in Richmond. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:24:33    Well, maybe also 'cause you grew up and you grew up with a certain people.  
Speaker 1    00:24:37    Yeah, yeah. And a good town. And then all of a sudden, you know, we had the bars here in Little Bird for, while the building up here had the, uh, cocking bull and uh,  
Speaker 0    00:25:02    Where was that?  
Speaker 1    00:25:05    The formula land. Oh,

Speaker 1    00:25:08    And Sally Guthrie, we talked our way out. <laugh>, Sally Guthrie had a, a little bearish was the formal restaurant. And she, she had the first tub and that was just jammed every, I mean, that was such fun. Then Turner Roy, I had the Cocking Bull back  
Speaker 0    00:25:35    Behind.  
Speaker 1    00:25:36    Yeah, no, I had the, that was the cocking bull. I can't remember The Night Fox.  
Speaker 0    00:25:48    Right.

Speaker 1    00:29:47    That started, um, after Phil Thomas' father and <Mayo Brown https://d1q40j6jx1d8h6.cloudfront.net/Obituaries/31783403/Thumbnail.jpg> started it. That's been going 75 years or so.  
Speaker 0    00:30:00    Wow. When did you move to Upperville?  
Speaker 1    00:30:13    Uh, bought the house, I think in 74, something like that.  
Speaker 0    00:30:20    And that's where you still are? Yeah. Is it, uh, where is it in Upperville?  
Speaker 1    00:30:28    In, well, it's in the Village. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But it's a block off of Route 50. It's down a lane next to a big pond.  
Speaker 0    00:30:38    That's nice.  
Speaker 1    00:30:40    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:30:40    Upperville seems also to not have, seems to not have changed as much as Middleburg  
Speaker 1    00:30:46    Has. Well, you know, that that's when, uh, she wanted to put the restaurant in. We were opposed to it because it was gonna have to change the zoning to put the restaurant in. And we didn't want Upperville to become another middle bird. I mean, the, I I remember when most of this was residential. Yeah. And, um, so we were opposed to it. And then, and then she put up the wide, the fence, the 17 foot fence and was gonna tear it down. And so I just threw my hands. I was on the committee opposing it. You  
Speaker 0    00:31:26    Were,  
Speaker 1    00:31:28    I think I was head of the committee. She was a little bit of a scary person. Mr.  
Speaker 0    00:31:36    I lived Upperville at the time also.  
Speaker 1    00:31:38    Oh, you did? On  
Speaker 0    00:31:39    Willville Road. Got across from Ellen Waterman.  
Speaker 1    00:31:43    Oh, right. <laugh>. But it's been wonderful. It's been wonderful for us. Wonderful for me. I just a block away. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:31:54    <affirmative>. <inaudible>.  
Speaker 1    00:31:56    Yeah. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:31:58    So it was the zoning for the town that people were opposed to and not as much having a restaurant there as what it might, as what it might Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:32:08    Might lead to bring  
Speaker 0    00:32:09    To the town.  
Speaker 1    00:32:09    Might bring to  
Speaker 0    00:32:10    The town. Right. Yeah. Are there still people that, um, are opposed to that?  
Speaker 1    00:32:16    I don't think so.  
Speaker 0    00:32:17    Seems like most of the people that  
Speaker 1    00:32:19    Work, I think she's kept her end up right. Yeah. I'm not sure if she can legally put that tent up every summer, but, you know, she closes early. Right. No noise. You know, you just don't know what you're gonna get when you Right, right. And time to time, you know, we hear rumor that she was gonna get a band there every, every night during the summer when they had one out. I think they had one out at, uh, the black phone and they were making money and then they weren't making money.  
Speaker 0    00:32:56    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:32:58    And I think she was tempted then to put a band, but it never came through. So  
Speaker 0    00:33:04    What's happening with the Black Farm now?  
Speaker 1    00:33:06    Well, they want to make a big, like a salama. Right, right. And  
Speaker 0    00:33:11    It's been held up for a while.  
Speaker 1    00:33:12    Yeah. Neighbors are not happy. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:33:15    <affirmative>. Ksby was the same, you know, he's Yeah. Seems to be a trade off to keep some of these big parcels intact. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:33:27    I much sold Ksby.  
Speaker 0    00:33:28    You did  
Speaker 1    00:33:30    Rick Otro. That was a good year.  
Speaker 0    00:33:35    <laugh>. It's a beautiful  
Speaker 1    00:33:38    Property. Yeah. Oh, it was be, it was beautiful. That was so nice. I showed it to him Thursday and he called me Friday and said, come for a drink. And I went for a drink and he said, uh, George Hawkins go down on both ends. And I got a check.  
Speaker 0    00:33:57    George was the lawyer. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:34:02    Tony Wilkins.  
Speaker 0    00:34:03    So it was very much a gentleman's handshake to do business.  
Speaker 1    00:34:18    Yeah. Now, no test.  
Speaker 0    00:34:20    Rick Strom. Which Strom is he?  
Speaker 1    00:34:22    Rick is Buzz's, uh, brother, big brother. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:34:34    But he sold it then?  
Speaker 1    00:34:36    Well, he, he traded wives a lot and the next wife wanted his house back, which is old Whitewood. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Where they had the event. Right. Yeah. And he wanted to get it back. So he Martins, you know Julie Martin? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Okay. The Martins traded, they had, they had bought old Whitewood and they traded it back. They bought, they moved it Kate Street  
Speaker 0    00:35:12    And then,  
Speaker 1    00:35:13    And Rick moved back. Right. Old Whitewood,  
Speaker 0    00:35:18    Which is still going. Yes. Well, Keith is not so much, I  
Speaker 1    00:35:26    Dunno, I dunno. It's divided up a  
Speaker 0    00:35:29    Lot. Yeah. There's properties off the back  
Speaker 1    00:35:31    There. Yeah. Batman bought it, you know, and built the racetrack and everything. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:35:36    <affirmative>. <affirmative>, that was not a local person.  
Speaker 1    00:35:42    No, he was a Iranian close friend of Gaza. The Shaws,  
Speaker 0    00:35:53    There was a lot of Iranian people around. It seems  
Speaker 1    00:35:58    They had to go somewhere. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:36:04    Um, have you been married?  
Speaker 1    00:36:07    No. No. Just at the time when I, everybody had gotten married in Richmond. I left. And I'll tell you didn't have to be married.  
Speaker 0    00:36:20    Where? What do you mean? You didn't have to be married  
Speaker 1    00:36:22    And Well, you didn't, I just didn't really feel able to need in Richmond. You, I felt, you know, that I should be getting married. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But I didn't want to stay there. I was in a family business, but I, daddy had a heart attack and I just came in and, uh, then he gave me a third of the company and I felt obligated to stay, but I never thought I would do that. And, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:36:59    What was the  
Speaker 1    00:36:59    I to heat house? Like, and insulation and air conditioning, everything. I didn't understand. I went to liberal law school, hammer in   
Speaker 1    00:37:17    Didn't understand a bit. And it was about the end of town from the Deep Run Hunt Club. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I kept wanting him to build a place, you know, have a branch up in Goman, you know, where Deep Run is. No. Anyway, but the Hunt Club way, way west of  
Speaker 0    00:37:43    Richmond  
Speaker 1    00:37:43    West. Okay. And daddy's company was way east of East end of Richmond. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So it was my, all my customers were Gland County people.  
Speaker 0    00:37:56    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:37:58    Didn't make sense.  
Speaker 0    00:38:01    Richmond's changed an  
Speaker 1    00:38:02    Awful lot. Yeah. Everybody says it's wonderful. Have family though.  
Speaker 0    00:38:06    Do you go back there a  
Speaker 1    00:38:07    Lot? No. <laugh>. Well, you know, most of my friends did anyway. So.  
Speaker 0    00:38:16    Well, you were able to make a very beautiful life here. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:38:20    Yeah. That's about simple for me.  
Speaker 0    00:38:22    Outdoor pursuits and horses and a little bit of real estate.  
Speaker 1    00:38:27    Yeah. Yeah. It was easy. You know, the two complimented each other. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:38:38    <affirmative>. Yeah. They really do. Can't see, there's a lot of this countryside you can't see except on the back of the horse.  
Speaker 1    00:38:47    Yeah. I don't think I ever did that. But anyway. It could have, could have.  
Speaker 0    00:38:54    We always used to say that if people could see what we saw hacking out, they wouldn't build.  
Speaker 1    00:38:59    Yeah. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:39:01    Nearly, you know, 10 houses per acre. And how do you think that the development has been handled in  
Speaker 1    00:39:14    Well, beautifully. Don't you, don't you feel that way? I don't, I don't feel any, you know, it's, it's not as small as it was, but that we are. Right. It was nice when it was small and lucky it all the, my friends were good friends to have and they made it easy for me. Bill Perry, you know, we had Perry. Anyway, he didn't lent me a horse from a Maclay and he <affirmative> and he had left Charlottesville and moved up here Right. With his fourth wife. And, uh, so he was really good to me. And as Randolph was really good to me. And, uh, the Wiley and Paul. So  
Speaker 0    00:40:19    Good people.  
Speaker 1    00:40:20    It was wonderful. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:40:21    Where did the Perrys live?  
Speaker 1    00:40:23    Well, then they lived at Dresden. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:40:28    And Ms. Randolph,  
Speaker 1    00:40:30    Ms. Randolph was at Oakley where, uh, he grandson is now. That's his name. Robin is one grandson. Bonnie Shelby. Shelby. Shelby is the Oakley. It's beautiful. R  
Speaker 0    00:40:53    We're just <inaudible>.  
Speaker 1    00:40:55    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:41:02    Is there a big divide between, um, Upperville and Middleburg?  
Speaker 1    00:41:11    Not then. Maybe more Now,  
Speaker 0    00:41:16    Why do you think  
Speaker 1    00:41:20    Orange County, orange County voice of the Yankees and, and Ms. Randolph used to, to kid that she should, she should actually be in Orange County. And she did move to Orange County one night when, when Mr. Winthrop, her husband in Boston, locked her on Long Island, I believe they lived locked her in her room. And when he came to let her out, she was gone. She was gone out the window and was gone halfway to Virginia. And, uh, another interesting thing is, you know how you get newspapers with the date you were born, the New York newspapers. And somebody gave me one and it had the Pipe and Rock Horse Show. And the Pipe and Rock Horse show was run by Mrs. Robert Winthrop, who was Mrs. Randolph, and guess who the judge was? Dr. AC Randolph. She'd had him come up to judge your horse show.  
Speaker 1    00:42:27    And so when she came here, he was, he was married, but his wife was dying. And she became the little master. She rode right behind him at a hunting for my time. Right. And I, I heard tell about, and, uh, when the wife died, she married and, uh, Mr. Re, her father, uh, who had all the money, she'd had a sister who died in a horse accident. So she was a, so Aris and, uh, her, her father was one of 12 children, and his father had been a sea captain, had left each child a million dollars. And Dr. And Mr. Ayre, Ms. Randolph's father had put his in in, uh, bird eye peas and Cat Kodak cameras and made lot of them anyway. And Dr. Randolph was a doctor, but he never practiced. He had rich wis, he had two, two rich wis. And, uh, Dr. Randolph called me.  
Speaker 1    00:43:43    I mean, Mr. Ayer called Dr. Randolph up and he said, I have a daughter and I understand you have the best pack of hounds in the United States, but also you have no real money. And my daughter will now be happy married to a man with no real money. So I'm putting a million dollars in the bank for you to draw on. That was a lot of money back in those days. And of course, she paid for everything. So, uh, when he, he had Parkinson's or something that was gonna kill him. And he got very difficult and drank a lot and got difficult. And so she moved next to a Oakland and, uh, two of his children got together, then got Dr. R. So the schoolmate, who I used to ride for in Richmond, who was a lawyer, was the best lawyer in Richmond to sue her for desertion for divorce. And that way, uh, uh, the widows Dow was out and the kids would get all the money that Dr. Randolph hadn't spent when he died. But she got back in the house and established residence. And then she moved him over to Oakland and built an addition for him. And when I moved up here, she was still taking care of the nurse she had hired to take care of Dr. Rph. Where did she grow up? Boston. She went to Fox Grove. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So she knew the area. She knew Dr. Randall.  
Speaker 1    00:45:19    And he was a local man. Oh yeah, yeah. Old, well, uh, had been his family place. And uh, then one of his wife, I think he lived at <inaudible> and somewhere else. And then of course with his, the Smiths, Bob Smith's place was his, he lived when he was married and his Randolph, and she bought Oakland next door. Well, I might run on, is that enough? That is wonderful. I will let you know there any other questions that I have.
