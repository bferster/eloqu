Speaker 1    00:08:50    And she didn't come. She stayed  
Speaker 0    00:08:52    In Salem. Oh no. She stayed Salem  
Speaker 2    00:08:56    Until the end.  
Speaker 1    00:08:59    She came  
Speaker 0    00:09:00    Here, got a letter from my grandmother, and she told my mother, this is my father's mother. She said, I'd rather see my man, my son dead than not there with that woman. That's how she always referred to her as that woman,  
Speaker 1    00:09:20    Mrs. Whitney. What'd she have against her?  
Speaker 0    00:09:25    She was rather notorious  
Speaker 1    00:09:28    For what?  
Speaker 0    00:09:29    For men in her life. But, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:09:34    And how'd she get the, the farm? Did she, she must have had a, huh? She must have been pretty wealthy to have the farm  
Speaker 0    00:09:42    Childhood. Hay Whitney owned the New York Times. Owned  
Speaker 1    00:09:45    The  
Speaker 0    00:09:45    New York Times. His sister owned the Mets baseball team. Yeah. You could say that. A little buddy <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:09:52    A little bit of money.  
Speaker 0    00:09:54    And then bad money had an old guy in Salem that, uh, owed father some money and he wouldn't pay him. But he had a tame bear brown, a little brown bear. Uh, this is during the war when, you know, all he had was a coop and this guy with him. And they took the back seat out and put it up and stuck it between the top seat, put the bear in the back and put the seat between them so the bear could reach around with his paws around the edges, but couldn't get out of. And, uh, the bear was doing fine when he was with those people. He got a little annoyed when he took him away.  
Speaker 2    00:10:59    So did your dad, did he give your dad the bear?  
Speaker 0    00:11:03    Well, yeah. In payment for what he owed him. Huh?  
Speaker 2    00:11:07    What was your dad gonna do with a bear? Huh? Chase the monkeys  
Speaker 0    00:11:13    Father, another particularly cared. And, uh, he just took it up there and added it to the menagerie. So he had a night watchman who was supposed to make rounds and clock in and he'd crawl up on the shelf in the kitchen and have a big wood stove and go to sleep.  
Speaker 2    00:11:33    The bear?  
Speaker 0    00:11:35    Uh, no, the night watchmen. Oh, <laugh>. So they got back, like old about one o'clock in the morning. I think both of 'em were a little fired up. And he had the bear on the chain and there were Dutch doors in the kitchen. So he just lit the bear through the lower half of the Dutch door and shut the door and lit him in there. And the bear was sniffing all around and the guy woke up,  
Speaker 2    00:12:05    <laugh> the  
Speaker 0    00:12:06    Bear, saw the bear, and damn near tore the kitchen door off the head. Just getting out there. <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:12:12    <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:12:14    That's  
Speaker 1    00:12:15    Good. What kind of a bear was it?  
Speaker 0    00:12:17    Just a little,  
Speaker 1    00:12:19    Like a little brown  
Speaker 0    00:12:19    Bear Brown bear a brown bear. Oh, it was about 300 pounders. Yeah.

Speaker 2    00:12:24    Gosh.  
Speaker 0    00:12:27    And then she had a dairy there where she ripped some calves and the guys that worked in the dairy got a, uh, uh, bag of, uh, milk every day. And, uh, the bear was kind of running around free like everything else up there to Monashee old man Cooper. He was walking up the hill with his gum boots and the pae of milk. And the bear was walking behind him, drinking down the pae. And he hadn't seen him. He finally saw him. He said he threw the bucket up in the air about 20 feet and ran it up to Hill <laugh>. And they'd always been worried about his heart. They didn't worry about his heart after that. <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:13:15    Oh my gosh. Huh.  
Speaker 0    00:13:20    But old man Cooper, he came from Salem with father, father brought him up, worked in the dairy.  
Speaker 2    00:13:27    And that's the one who owed him the money, or am I  
Speaker 1    00:13:29    Getting Gave him the bear. Gave

And since I would go to Saratoga to, uh, with the yearlings, uh, he would get me to, I would fill vans for him, horses leaving, you know, coming back to Virginia and stuff. And in payment for that, he'd take a sailing. He was a good sailor. And he'd rent a boat. We'd go down to Chesapeake Bay for a week, and Liz Whitney had this god damn cast iron piano that somebody had given her. The little bastard wasn't about as long as that bench. And, and it was about this high and it was cast iron. It weighed a ton. And we would always have to ship that up there and a workhorse harness for driving the workhorses. So we'd do all that stuff.  
Speaker 2    00:19:19    She'd take her piano to New York with her every time. Huh? She took her piano.  
Speaker 0    00:19:24    Oh yeah. So, uh, we had to ship it up and back. So I called her up when I got up there, I said, your piano's here. She said, well bring it over to the house. I said, Madam, that thing weighs 300 pounds easy. And we got it here. If you want it, come get it. It's sitting on the dock and that's where it's gonna stay until you pick it up and your harness is there with it. I piled that on top. Well, you little <laugh>. So she got all huffy happy. And then later on she invited me over for a drink. She said, you're an ornery little devil, aren't you? I said, no, ma'am, but fair, fair. And she said, okay, I get that. And we were, we were good friends.

That's why <laugh> and, uh, no, we had a, we'd get help from all of the different farms and they'd saved up their vacation time till then. And we'd go up there for a week for the sales, and then I'd put 'em on a van coming home. And I had one guy who had a car and he'd take two or three in the car.

Speaker 0    00:22:49    He had three or four vans out there. And he had the big one, he had a, he knew he had a bad heart 'cause he had had rheumatic fever when he was a kid. And the operation was only a 50 50 deal in those days. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He said, that isn't good enough odds. And he fell over and I called the doctor in the planes and he came rushing out and he said, Lou, he's dead. I said, I know he, I said, but if you say he is dead, all this help here is gonna go home. Now I got 35 year in here to put on his vans, which you say, just take him to the hospital. And he said, okay, I'll do that. So they loaded him in the ambulance and took him to <inaudible>. And, uh, we loaded the, uh, loaded the vans and I sent mud on the head and gave him a handful of money. And uh, they went up there and got all the horses loaded down. And I came up a couple days later, Sandy, you know, stayed back and drove up with him. It was a tough time, but it was, I was so busy I didn't have chance  
Speaker 0    00:24:11    To worry about it. And, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:24:16    What year was that?  
Speaker 0    00:24:17    Huh?  
Speaker 1    00:24:18    When was that?  
Speaker 2    00:24:19    69?  
Speaker 0    00:24:20    Yeah, 1969.  
Speaker 1    00:24:25    So you went off to college, university. And before that you had just only come here in the summer? Yeah. And where did you go to University  
Speaker 0    00:24:39    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:24:41    And you were  
Speaker 0    00:24:41    There? The university.  
Speaker 1    00:24:43    The university. And what did you study there?  
Speaker 0    00:24:49    I was an English major and I said, really, this isn't gonna do me any good. So I switched to economics and I finally managed to get, I had plenty of hours, but no, not enough credits. So I switched to, uh, economics and I got, uh, and I really did use that education. It benefited me a lot. Like when a deal is done, when it isn't done, when you cash a check, when you don't. And, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:25:30    So you would've graduated in what year?  
Speaker 0    00:25:34    Uh, should have graduated in 61, but I dropped down a year, <laugh> a year, and, uh, came up here and stayed with my dad on the farm. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:25:52    And when did you buy this place?  
Speaker 0    00:25:57    He and Molly bought this place in, uh,  
Speaker 2    00:26:02    60,  
Speaker 0    00:26:04    Uh, 1960, I guess.  
Speaker 1    00:26:08    So that year that you came, they had just bought it?  
Speaker 0    00:26:13    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:26:15    And who's Molly  
Speaker 2    00:26:16    Stepmother?  
Speaker 0    00:26:19    I'd had three mothers, my real mother and then Kitty Wiley, who got me into Hill school in Pennsylvania.  
Speaker 0    00:26:31    And that really changed my life. That was, this is one of the best things that ever happened to me because I was running with a fast crowd at Salem, drinking whiskey, 14, 15 years old. And I went up there and had a very good sports program, which I liked. And matter of fact, we went up, they took me up to look at the school, Kenny and Dad, and I'd never see anything like it. They had all these things you could do and do and, uh, but I had a pretty good thing going in high school. So <laugh>. So would you like to go here? I said, God, yes. I'd love it. I mean, the football team was already back. I figured I had a whole year to figure out a way to get around it. And they said, well, good, you'd be up here in a week. I went, what? Man? My mother was not happy.  
Speaker 1    00:27:32    I bet  
Speaker 0    00:27:33    We had to go buy clothes and everything. We had to wear a coat and tie the class. And I had a old Army Foot Locker with everything in it. And another little suitcase. I got it out. We had an old Plymouth Station wagon. We drove up from Salem and I remember we spent the night in called Pepper. And uh, it was 1953. And uh, I got the trunk out, the suitcase. She said, you got everything. She was still sitting in the driver's seat. And I said, yeah. And I shut the back door and she said bye, and drove off, never kissed me goodbye or anything. And I stood there and looked around and I said, what in the hell am I going to do? I'm sitting here in the middle of nowhere and don't know anybody. But it soon was all.  
Speaker 1    00:28:30    And did you start there in high school then? Ninth grade?  
Speaker 0    00:28:33    Well, I'd done so poorly there that I had to repeat a grade. So,  
Speaker 1    00:28:43    So you were there four years at the Hill School? Yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:28:45    I was four years.  
Speaker 1    00:28:46    And did you play, what sports did you play?  
Speaker 0    00:28:49    I got out in 57, went in 53, and, uh,  
Speaker 2    00:28:57    Football, wrestling. Football?  
Speaker 0    00:29:00    Yeah, football, wrestling. Track, track.

Speaker 0    00:29:11    No, she was from Birmingham, Alabama.  
Speaker 2    00:29:14    Hmm. Was she really? I didn't know that.  
Speaker 1    00:29:17    How did they meet?  
Speaker 0    00:29:20    I have no idea.  
Speaker 2    00:29:22    They weren't Ma How long were they married?  
Speaker 0    00:29:25    Quite a good while. Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:29:29    Did she have an affiliation with the Hill School or she just thought it would be a good thing  
Speaker 0    00:29:33    For you? No, my brother had gone there. I see. And at that time he was head of the Voices of America. Really? Yeah. His name was Edward Barrett and she was Kitty Barrett. And then she bought the mill house.  
Speaker 1    00:29:56    What's the, the mill house  
Speaker 2    00:29:58    In  
Speaker 0    00:29:58    Middleware big house there on 50 in Middleburg. Right. As you go down to the one of those bottom, and then you see a big mill back in there and everything. You would fifth sold it then. Huh? S

Speaker 1    00:30:28    And where'd you live before you lived here then?

They split up and then go back together. They just kept, kept the divorce papers and dusted them off <laugh>. They never really, you know. But, uh, uh, and

Speaker 1    00:32:45    Center,  
Speaker 0    00:32:45    Yeah. Oh, and the one I really remember was, uh, Kathy Mellon's coming out party. Paul Melon took the horseshoe barn, took all the horses out of it, repainted it, had fruit trees planted outside with fruit on them. And then each stall was a shot. Like you could go in and get your picture taken in one shot. You could go in and get a drink and another shot. You could go all these little different shots. And, uh, Kenny and Father were chaperones for the party. I remember we had an 88, uh, rose Mobile convertible.  
Speaker 2    00:33:41    An 88.  
Speaker 0    00:33:44    That's what they call 'em. You had an 88 and a 98  
Speaker 2    00:33:48    Back in the sixties?  
Speaker 0    00:33:49    Yeah, it was a model. Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:33:52    Was alright.  
Speaker 0    00:33:53    And the top was down. We were driving back in the tuxedos. He wore a tuxedo to everything in those days. I mean, if you were invited over to, uh, Mellon's Daughter's for dinner party, he was seated dinner with, uh, tuxedo. And after dinner, the little dining room was cleared of tables and a little ensemble would come in and play music. And your dance very sporty. And now tuxedos, tuxedo took a lot of wear.  
Speaker 1    00:34:39    And was that just at the melons or was that something that everybody did?  
Speaker 0    00:34:43    Everybody did. I mean, if you went out for the night, you were expected to dress.  
Speaker 1    00:34:51    And how was something going on every weekend? Was there a season for that or?  
Speaker 0    00:34:56    Oh yeah, Christmas season.  
Speaker 1    00:34:58    Christmas season.  
Speaker 0    00:34:59    That's when the Debs came out. All the summer really didn't matter. And once the Jackson's built the community center, it was always a place to have a party.  
Speaker 2    00:35:14    When was that built? Community Center. I dunno. I can look it up. I didn't know. So it was always here  
Speaker 0    00:35:21    We were. Hal Jackson built it. Yeah. Or Mr. Uh, the builder from, uh, Warrenton built it.

Speaker 1    00:36:09    Look like this anymore. <laugh>? Nah,  
Speaker 0    00:36:10    That was a funeral. We'd been to a wedding and we were sitting in the old Cipher Home, which was the rectory those days. Right. Drunkest Rats.  
Speaker 2    00:36:27    Now those three were trouble. Two of them still are.  
Speaker 0    00:36:34    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:36:35    That. When was that taken then? Do you know about what year that was?  
Speaker 0    00:36:41    I have no idea. No.  
Speaker 4    00:36:44    I can tell by your glasses  
Speaker 5    00:36:45    The stage of your glasses. I'd say eighties. I,  
Speaker 1    00:36:49    Yeah, you can tell people's, oh, no, hold on. Well above it says 91.  
Speaker 4    00:36:55    That's Leslie and Andrew's. That's at, that's at the Young's house. That's Leslie and Andrew's wedding picture. So late nineties.  
Speaker 1    00:37:03    Hmm. Looks good.  
Speaker 2    00:37:09    I stink. Sorry.  
Speaker 1    00:37:13    So you'd have parties and was it the same crowd or did people come in and out from different places?  
Speaker 0    00:37:21    Well, you'd invite people, you know, a lot of their friends that went to school with and stuff would come and stay with people, and it was very festive. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And if you had a father like mine, he would say, if you can play all night, maybe you can dance all day now. Get your butt out of bed and get some work done. So, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:37:51    So then you came to live here when the farm was bought in the sixties?  
Speaker 0    00:37:55    Well, in the, I fixed up a little house down in the woods mm-hmm <affirmative>. Down here and fixed that up with the help of a farmer here. And we put in air heat. And,  
Speaker 2    00:38:10    And that's where you and mom lived after you got married? Yeah. Is that your first house? Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:38:14    Yeah. And she, it was  
Speaker 1    00:38:15    Your mom from here too?  
Speaker 2    00:38:17    Uhhuh <affirmative>. She grew up in Warrenton. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:38:19    She lived right down the road in Meadowville. So I just went down there and pick her up  
Speaker 2    00:38:29    Easy enough,  
Speaker 0    00:38:31    Pick her up. And her father was a veterinarian. And her mother, I was totally crazy about her. And somebody said, aren't you scared dating Dr. Howard's stepdaughter? I said, hell no. I got enough on him to kill him. I said, her mother terrorizes me <laugh>. I went up, told her I wanted to marry a daughter. She said, how do you know? I, I had a big old German Shepherd named Dirty. And I said, well, I like her more than I do my dog. She said, that's good enough for me. <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:39:14    How did you two meet?  
Speaker 0    00:39:16    Huh?  
Speaker 1    00:39:16    How did you meet her?  
Speaker 2    00:39:20    You and Tommy Stokes were good buddies?  
Speaker 0    00:39:22    Yeah. And I knew Dr. Howwell and I, you know,  
Speaker 2    00:39:29    She's how much younger? Seven years younger than you? So  
Speaker 0    00:39:33    Yeah. Monk fixed me up with the first date. Uncle Monk. Monk Mon Nolan. She  
Speaker 2    00:39:40    Had been, he had dry cleaners in town.  
Speaker 0    00:39:42    She had been jilted by her boyfriend at the time. And she was down. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:39:50    They paid you didn't, they didn't gam and pop up, say take her to the hunt ball or something.  
Speaker 0    00:39:57    Yeah, I took her, I had a Mustang, that convertible love of my life. And, uh,  
Speaker 2    00:40:10    More said,  
Speaker 0    00:40:12    We drove over to the community center, FL party and coming home, I'd been well served. I got it far as halfway and I pulled over and I said, all right, you either go to late, stay here for a while while I take a snooze or you can drive. She said, I can't drive a stick shift. I said, I'll show you how you just, and I got her started off and every time she had to stop, she just stepped on the brake. We had to start all over again. <laugh>. But we got home. She was afraid that was where I was going, make my move. She said,  
Speaker 2    00:40:54    I heard her story. She wore her dress up to here, down to here. And  
Speaker 0    00:40:58    <laugh>. Yeah. <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:41:00    So there's no way I was sitting on the side of the road.  
Speaker 0    00:41:06    Apparently my reputation preceded me to, anyhow.  
Speaker 1    00:41:12    When you moved here, what was the operation here? How many? It was horses. Yeah. And,  
Speaker 0    00:41:19    Well, we built this barn over here. <affirmative> handbag built that same guy, built a community center. And we, uh, we keep all the yearlings and that, that we're going to the sale and get 'em ready and teach 'em how to walk and how to be own. And we taught a lot of people how to do it. They would send their horses down to us starting out, and then they would see how we do it, and then they'd go do it on their own.  
Speaker 1    00:42:00    So did you breed horses here as well?  
Speaker 0    00:42:04    Uh, we did, but it was very low key. So  
Speaker 1    00:42:08    Most, most of them came from other places.  
Speaker 0    00:42:11    Yeah. The horses we sold at Saratoga were not something we bred. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We did not have those kind of horses.  
Speaker 1    00:42:20    How long would the horses be here for Bebo? They would go to Saratoga  
Speaker 0    00:42:24    At least six weeks to get to. And when was  
Speaker 2    00:42:29    That barn  
Speaker 0    00:42:30    Built with the, to get the job built? Get it done right, mm-hmm <affirmative>. And we'd have a blacksmith to come in and work on 'em about every other week. So we got their feet like we wanted them.  
Speaker 1    00:42:41    Right.  
Speaker 2    00:42:43    And then why did you build that barn, Bey's barn?  
Speaker 0    00:42:46    Well, there was just a, uh, I was just a cow shed and I, I built it just like a pole barn and built that myself. Well, I had the guy build it, but I showed him not to do it.  
Speaker 1    00:43:08    W beyond the six weeks that the horses were here. And when you were at Saratoga, what did you do in the fall and the winter?  
Speaker 0    00:43:18    Uh, in the fall we had cows and we had to feed them in the winter. And then we bought the farm across the road around Century and, uh, that had a dairy barn on it. And so I ran up to Al Miller's junkyard, which is right there at Belfor. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And barred as a settling torch. And it didn't like a modern milking parlor where he just milk three or four cows. It was long stanchions. And I know what father was planting and I had worked in the dairy. Chet, you know, he didn't believe in generators and all that. So when the power was out, he had to milk these damn things by hand. Uh, so I went up to Elma Miller's and got a cutting torch and I cut every one of the stanchions off level with the concrete floor. He came back and he looked in there and he said, what have you done? I was gonna get some cows. I said, I knew that <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:44:38    Oh, I was gonna say, were there already cows? You did this so he wouldn't get dairy cows.  
Speaker 0    00:44:43    You damn right. <laugh>. He wasn't going to be, I wasn't going be squeezing tents for <laugh> 24 hours a day while he was out somewhere else. No, sir.  
Speaker 2    00:44:56    How did that go over?  
Speaker 0    00:44:58    He didn't care for it too much, but, uh, we got into beef cows and   
Speaker 0    00:45:07    I showed him there of his ways. We raised enough feed for him and everything.  
Speaker 2    00:45:17    So you started beef cattle in the sixties too? Just as soon as you got mad eccentric.  
Speaker 0    00:45:23    Just me and Sam. Yeah. We had a red hay bar out there. We put all the hay in that and made only square bales. We didn't even have a round baler  
Speaker 2    00:45:36    Because the cows weren't getting a square meal with the round bales.  
Speaker 0    00:45:41    <laugh>   
Speaker 0    00:45:43    We got, uh, shoot, we'd work till 6 37 at night.  
Speaker 1    00:45:51    How many cows were here?  
Speaker 0    00:45:54    I had about a hundred.  
Speaker 1    00:45:59    That's a full-time job. Plus, yeah. Who's Sam? Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:46:06    Uh, I came in one night.  
Speaker 2    00:46:10    Who's Sam though?  
Speaker 0    00:46:11    Huh?  
Speaker 2    00:46:12    Sam Kenard. Sam, she asked who Sam is.  
Speaker 0    00:46:16    Yeah,  
Speaker 2    00:46:17    Sam Kenard.  
Speaker 0    00:46:18    Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:46:19    He, he was kind of the yard man. He lives down here. Yeah, he  
Speaker 0    00:46:23    Lived, he scattered in the yard. We were the only thing we were, we did it all.  
Speaker 3    00:46:28    Yeah.

Speaker 2    00:50:56    Hmm.

Speaker 1    00:51:21    The whole thing. So they were,  
Speaker 0    00:51:28    Uh,  
Speaker 2    00:51:28    Leslie Van San told me her grandparents built Mount centric.  
Speaker 0    00:51:32    Huh?  
Speaker 2    00:51:34    This, this mother at Hill School said her grandparents were the ones that built Mount Centric, but I couldn't, I don't know the math of it. All that the years, all I didn't know.  
Speaker 1    00:51:48    So you would've gotten that in the sixties?  
Speaker 0    00:51:50    Yeah,  
Speaker 1    00:51:52    Sometime in the sixties.  
Speaker 2    00:51:52    And then you moved there, you and mom lived there? Yeah, I was born there.  
Speaker 0    00:51:57    Yeah. Already had Elizabeth.  
Speaker 2    00:52:03    They  
Speaker 0    00:52:03    Needed, I remember I took your mother in there to look at it the first time, and it's a big old house. It's bigger than that house. And all the rooms were printed into a dark color, which made 'em look like Kays. And she put her hands on her face and started crying. So I said, okay. So I got a guy to work on the house and painted every room, all white, one color through the whole house, which really helped everything.  
Speaker 2    00:52:41    That's  
Speaker 0    00:52:41    A great help. And then, uh, Warrenton <inaudible>, she was secretary for the horse show. Right. And the steward always stayed with us. So this was down when I was in the woods. So I started getting them. I didn't want to come listen to all that crap that went on the horse show all day. So I got him a room at Howard Johnson's each a room and paid for it, and they stayed there. So  
Speaker 1    00:53:13    Your mom and him  
Speaker 0    00:53:15    And Steward?  
Speaker 2    00:53:16    My mom and the steward stayed at Howard Johnson. Yeah. So she didn't have to drive back and forth? Yeah,  
Speaker 1    00:53:22    No. So he didn't have to listen to them?  
Speaker 0    00:53:24    No, I didn't have to listen to it. And the Stu was a good friend of mine too. I really liked it. She was, she was, uh, her name was O'Neill.  
Speaker 2    00:53:35    It was a woman. Yeah. I thought you were putting your wife and a guy up in a hotel  
Speaker 0    00:53:39    Together. I was like, wait a minute. I'm and her brother. Oh.  
Speaker 2    00:53:43    About  
Speaker 0    00:53:44    Her brother Buck O'Connell ran Morgan Park for, uh, van Cleef. So we had a lot of Italians, but mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, back in those days, you used to have yearling shows and you'd go around different farms and look at the yearlings mm-hmm <affirmative>. And they'd feed you lunch and stuff. Very festive. But they quit that. So anyway,  
Speaker 1    00:54:10    Seems like there were a lot more parties back in the day,  
Speaker 2    00:54:13    Right? I know. I think we, um, we  
Speaker 1    00:54:14    Have to up our game.  
Speaker 2    00:54:15    Up our game.  
Speaker 0    00:54:16    Well, uh, she and Ms. O'Neill were at the horse show staying in the Hyatt Johnson's. I moved, I moved all their clothes.  
Speaker 2    00:54:29    Oh, over to Mount  
Speaker 0    00:54:30    Centric? To Mount Centric. Moved all the furniture Gizmo you need to go out <laugh> Woo. Who? Yeah, Booey. So she came back and opened the door to the house and nothing was there,  
Speaker 1    00:54:49    This house.  
Speaker 2    00:54:49    And you hadn't told her  
Speaker 0    00:54:51    Over here? I hadn't even told her. And I took her over to the big house. She looked at it and she said, my God, it's a lot different. Uh, yeah. They didn't allow drinking in the big house. His mother-in-law. So then Sam and I must have gotten a hay wagon full of  
Speaker 2    00:55:14    Who didn't allow drinking

Speaker 1    00:55:33    They'd go outside,  
Speaker 0    00:55:34    Just go outside and drink. And then you just leave the bottle where it was empty.  
Speaker 2    00:55:39    Huh?

Speaker 0    01:09:32    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:09:34    And you have some horses here now. Are those yours or  
Speaker 2    01:09:40    All mine. I can't get enough <laugh> Ally. How No, what? So Elizabeth, she shows they hunt. James is over there training hunter jumpers or box hunters.

Speaker 1    01:10:14    When you were at the, when you had, how many did you ever have over there?  
Speaker 0    01:10:20    Racehorse? I had a full barn in Middleburg and everything. I had probably 15 brood, man. I had a lot of horses.  
Speaker 2    01:10:30    Horrible. Yeah, we were big in that training track over in Middleburg.  
Speaker 0    01:10:35    Yeah, I owned that. Well, we had a bunch of people. We bought it from Mellon. He built it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:10:42    The one that's over on the, like St. Louis, St. Louis Road.  
Speaker 0    01:10:45    Yeah. And so he wanted to sell it, but he wanted it to be a community thing. So Paul Feld and I went to him and offered to buy it. And he said, well, it's gotta be a community. And we said, alright there, here's that proposal that 11 barns and we'll have 11 stockholders and we'll draw up plans. He said, all right, fine. Proceed. So, uh, <laugh>, it's amusing story. We had everybody lined up who wanted to get in it. And c the guest had a,  
Speaker 3    01:11:46    A  
Speaker 0    01:11:48    Barn with about four show horses in it. And, uh, she said she, you know, not fool with these people. And we said, all right. And so we were at Saratoga and we charged everybody a thousand dollars up front. And then you had to rent a barn with that. You got a barn and it was up to you to fill your barn up. And we got, uh, we called cc's husband and, uh, and Ireland the, to see if he wanted the barn. 'cause Easy said she didn't have, she wasn't dealing with us. And uh, she only dealt with Mr. Mellon. Hey bitch. Okay. So he said, no, he had no ing need for a barn there. I looked at that and I said, we've done our duty. But I said, uh, go to the bank and tell 'em do not accept any deposits in their account. Old economics. He said, uh, what do you mean? I said, everybody knows that she only had to put up a thousand dollars. If she sends a certified check down here and we accept it, it's deposited in our account, then she's automatically in, it becomes a contract. He said, you sure about that? I said, I'm dead sure about that. So we told the bank and the a special carrier came down from bank in New York and said, we've never had a check refused, certified check. And I said, I'm sorry, you can't deposit in this account. We were refusing it.  
Speaker 0    01:14:03    He said, okay. He went back to New York and, uh, Mr. Mellon called Mr. Mellon's lawyer, called a guy named Weer or Whitmer, I can't remember. But he was a really sharp man from New York. And we told him what had happened. He said, stay right there. I'll call you back in five minutes. He called me and told him, and he called right back. He was laughing, <laugh>. And, uh, we said, yes. He said, Mr. Millon is laughing. He thinks that's the funniest thing that's ever happened. He said he doesn't like to bitch either. <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    01:14:53    So Cz guess is that, um,

Speaker 0    01:15:58    Well, the daughter, Ridge boy and his barn was full and the dummy would get checks to pay. It never deposited. Well, we want a tight schedule. You had to pay and we had a provision, if you don't pay, you lose your stock. And he'd come in with two or three payments and we'd let it go. And finally said, look Phil, you gotta start making these payments. And he said, well, sometimes I can't. He said, well then I'll tell you what, just take my stock. And he just gave it up. And so,

Speaker 3    01:21:07    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:21:08    Who was, who lived on it?  
Speaker 0    01:21:11    Truby Littleton and his wife Kathy.  
Speaker 2    01:21:16    That log book has some good stories.  
Speaker 1    01:21:19    That's a fun trip.  
Speaker 0    01:21:21    Chubby and I would go to the market and come back with one bag of groceries. That's all we needed for the whole trip. When Kathy went with us, she'd come back with three bags. She was knew. It's fun to find a place to put it.  
Speaker 1    01:21:46    Where'd you go to the market? Huh? Where did you go to the market?  
Speaker 0    01:21:51    We'd pull in into the dock and we'd call ahead. 'cause we knew which docks we liked. And we even had the charts. We had all triangled and heading. So if it was fog, we could run in the fog. A lot of times you had ground fog, you could look up and it was clear. And uh, so we got, so let Kathy, she'd go down in the car and meet us at night and stuff. That was a lot better because she was paid as poor. Thing is dead now. But, uh, she'd call in this harbor. We say, uh, we need a birth to for the night. What are you 35 foot sport fishermen. Will you be needing fuel? Yes. Come right on. We'll take a spot for you. They take a sailboat and just move it outta the way. Tie it to another one. 'cause we go in there and get the fuel and they let us stay right there at the fuel dock all night. And so in the morning we'd get up at the crack of dawn and we were gone. And, uh, it was a lot of fun. I was sitting on the front one morning in the fog and we were going down there.  
Speaker 0    01:23:23    Uh, trophy says, I can't see anything. I said, hell, I can't either. I'm sitting on the front up here. He says, I'm getting a blip off to the right. I said, well then you got some leeway here, go to the left a little bit. And we were motoring slow so there was no wake. And 35 Ford fishermen can roar right along. <laugh>. And this guy, we came to this little boat with three black guys in it. They were fishing, they had cigars and their eyes were about this big 'cause they could hear this thing coming and they couldn't see us or we couldn't see them. But we got 'em on the radar and we went by and I waved to 'em and they were ah, and they turned around, headed back to shore.  
Speaker 2    01:24:24    Not the day to be out.  
Speaker 0    01:24:25    They shouldn't have been out there anyway.

That, uh, he rode the train down to Manassas one time to a park down there. And they had a deer there. And I said, I was the first deer, live deer you'd ever seen. Mm-hmm

Speaker 1    01:27:58    Like  
Speaker 2    01:27:59    Mill Millwork.  
Speaker 0    01:28:00    Yeah. That's the same store. Same building.  
Speaker 2    01:28:05    I thought that was the cleaners though.

Speaker 0    01:28:20    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:28:22    Just past the millwork.  
Speaker 2    01:28:24    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:28:25    So the millwork was a car dealership.  
Speaker 2    01:28:28    Are you sure? I don't think so.  
Speaker 0    01:28:31    Hmm?  
Speaker 2    01:28:32    I don't think so. Yes,  
Speaker 0    01:28:33    It was.  
Speaker 1    01:28:34    But the millwork was on the main street.  
Speaker 2    01:28:36    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:28:37    Millbrook wasn't there. Millwork wasn't there.  
Speaker 2    01:28:39    Right.  
Speaker 0    01:28:41    Only Millwork was in Upperville. Big DuPont Follow on that  
Speaker 2    01:28:46    I thought across from Safeway or kind of closer up to the stoplight. There was a car dealership on that side kind of between like where Julian's was.  
Speaker 0    01:28:58    Oh, there was a car dealership in the back there. Chevrolet dealership, uh, back there where, uh, where the Knight Fox was. Not the Knight Fox, but the, you know, farther back where the architects and all that are now. Because a big building there.  
Speaker 2    01:29:18    Gail Wofford. And my mom had to send Jennifer n in our, in our night gowns in like third grade to the Night Fox to get our fathers out. <laugh>. They didn't want to go in. That was, there's some night Fox stories. I bet  
Speaker 1    01:29:33    The Night Fox was  
Speaker 2    01:29:35    Behind the Red fox.  
Speaker 1    01:29:36    Behind the Red Fox  
Speaker 2    01:29:38    Across from the pink fox, I guess.  
Speaker 3    01:29:41    Mm-hmm.  
Speaker 1    01:29:41    So they call the upstairs the Night Fox, but that's not,  
Speaker 0    01:29:45    They call it, they just use the name now, but  
Speaker 1    01:29:48    It's not the same thing. No. So there was a building behind here. Uh, I got this map in here.  
Speaker 0    01:29:58    Let me see it again.  
Speaker 1    01:30:00    So this is the community center, just to get you, so there was an ESO station in that courtyard right

Speaker 1    01:37:01    Did you drive? You'd drive all the way out there?  
Speaker 0    01:37:04    Hell no. We'd fly and then rent a car  
Speaker 1    01:37:06    And rent a car. And who would go with you?  
Speaker 0    01:37:11    Uh, Chris Cole and Larry Curtis. I, I all petered out.  
Speaker 2    01:37:28    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:37:30    Did that last a long time? Hmm? Did you go a lot of years?  
Speaker 0    01:37:36    Yeah. Yeah. I shot that out there.  
Speaker 2    01:37:40    Then you switched to South Dakota. Hmm. You kind of switched over to go to South Dakota. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 3    01:37:46    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 2    01:37:49    And that's when Carter was your handler?  
Speaker 0    01:37:52    Well, I couldn't do walking anymore, so I take my nephew with me, pay his way. And, uh, he had drive and I could, I could sit in the car and or sit on the back deck with the, with the tailgate open and shoot fence that came out from there. And I went down to Georgia a bunch of times. And  
Speaker 2    01:38:33    Quail.  
Speaker 0    01:38:35    Quail honey, wild quail. That'd sit in the Jeep. And you know, they have hot seats up in the back and dog boxes.  
Speaker 2    01:38:52    Is that legal?  
Speaker 0    01:38:53    Yeah.  
Speaker 2    01:38:54    Ride around in the car.  
Speaker 0    01:38:56    He is on a plantation.  
Speaker 3    01:38:59    We'll  
Speaker 1    01:38:59    Do whatever you want.  
Speaker 2    01:39:02    We need to go later.  
Speaker 0    01:39:03    And in Montana you could shoot from a car anyway. But this was Georgia,  
Speaker 2    01:39:08    South Georgia.  
Speaker 0    01:39:09    Yeah. Yeah. Albany, Georgia, Albany. And I'd sit up just high enough, you know, you sit way up above the driver and the driver and the dogs. And whoever was with me was walking. Only two of you could go and he's sheep. And you'd take six dogs and run 'em for a while and then get fresh ones. And I could sit up there and if I got a shot, it was fine. You know, I'd take it from there. But I'd been down there a while and they knew I was safe. So, uh,  
Speaker 2    01:39:50    I feel like you've got some good, um, um, what's her name? Some like Jackie o Stories and Kennedy and, uh, Elizabeth Taylor. Are those not appropriate?  
Speaker 1    01:40:09    Did you know Elizabeth Taylor?  
Speaker 0    01:40:12    Yes. Yeah. I'll tell you one thing. If you hadn't known who she was when you walked in, your eyes would've immediately gotten to her. Really? She was absolutely beautiful. Not very tall. Okay. I'll give you a cute story. Melvin Poe was a Huntsman Orange County. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And every year he gave, he had a big cookout up at his place. He'd dig a pit roast the pig.  
Speaker 1    01:40:47    What, where was his place?  
Speaker 0    01:40:49    Up in Hume. They'd have ton tournaments before. And  
Speaker 2    01:40:55    It was a huge part. I mean, it was fun. I went when I was little, didn't I? Huh? I used to go when I was little. Didn't I, I mean, I can remember everyone outside  
Speaker 0    01:41:03    And, uh, Sandy and I would go up there and Melvin made his own, made wine. And uh, we'd take the homemade wine and mix it with some green alcohol, homemade whiskey that somebody had brought. And they were potent. I mean, two or three. And you definitely needed somebody to help you drive. So, uh, John Warner, he had had a couple. He, Mayo Brown was driving them and he put him in the back of the car. He was out. Well, Elizabeth Taylor hung with us and we mixed the three of them. And I finally told Sandy, I said, Sandy, unless we gonna spend the night, we better head on down the hill while we still can navigate and pray for the best. He said, okay. So I saw Melvin the next day over here at the Kennel. I said, well, did uh, Ms. Warner go down? Go down? She had two more and left. Took a bottle of wine and damn hole made whiskey with her.  
Speaker 3    01:42:34    <laugh>  
Speaker 0    01:42:37    O Brown was driving. She used to come to the farm center. It was an equipment dealer. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, uh,  
Speaker 1    01:42:52    In Marshall?  
Speaker 0    01:42:53    No, I was up there in the rector tail.  
Speaker 1    01:42:57    Oh yeah. Right by  
Speaker 3    01:42:59    The jail.  
Speaker 0    01:43:02    In jail. <laugh>, Hey, bless. And uh, whenever she came to pick up, all of everything would stop.  
Speaker 1    01:43:24    She picked up her own parts.  
Speaker 0    01:43:26    And again, the guy that ran the place was big fat guy with smoking a cigar. He finally went to her and said, ma'am, would you mind staying in the car? 'cause when you leave, they'd still be talking about you for half round. I can't get any work done.  
Speaker 3    01:43:45    <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    01:43:46    She laughed. She said, fine. But  
Speaker 1    01:43:50    How long did she live here?  
Speaker 0    01:43:56    I guess till she left Florida and went back to  
Speaker 2    01:44:04    She was supposed to getting married what? Eight times? Is that what she did? Eight.  
Speaker 1    01:44:09    How long was, so she lived, she lived here the whole time she was married to him?  
Speaker 0    01:44:13    Yeah, he was state senator. See,  
Speaker 1    01:44:17    And was that his main residence then?  
Speaker 0    01:44:22    Yeah. Well I think he had an apartment in town. Right. She stayed out here. He stayed here.  
Speaker 2    01:44:30    It's kind of like you and Eric. Yeah. Apartment in town.  
Speaker 1    01:44:34    Me, Elizabeth too. I'm  
Speaker 2    01:44:35    Gonna start calling you t  
Speaker 0    01:44:40    No, I think he came back every night.  
Speaker 1    01:44:43    They did.  
Speaker 0    01:44:44    Huh?  
Speaker 1    01:44:45    May came back  
Speaker 2    01:44:46    Every night, you say?  
Speaker 1    01:44:47    Yeah, Mayo Brown drove him to town and back.  
Speaker 0    01:44:50    Huh?  
Speaker 1    01:44:50    Mayo Brown drove him to town. And back in the day, no,  
Speaker 0    01:44:55    Mayo ran the farm. Uhhuh. And that kept him busy.  
Speaker 1    01:45:01    So he had another driver probably.  
Speaker 0    01:45:03    I don't know. That  
Speaker 2    01:45:04    Would've been a long way to, I mean, without 66  
Speaker 3    01:45:08    And  
Speaker 0    01:45:08    Well,  
Speaker 1    01:45:08    I Not as much traffic though. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:45:10    Well he had that other farm over there. He bought a red bank  
Speaker 3    01:45:14    Where?  
Speaker 0    01:45:15    Over near Berryville.  
Speaker 2    01:45:19    It's not in the right direction.  
Speaker 0    01:45:21    Huh?

Nobody around here did, but a guy Phil Nelson and Warren did. And he was doing all the work. And this, this nursing woman from the Washington Post showed up one Sunday we were out there and fa and I were over there cleaning stuff up and moving trees and getting things outta the way.

Speaker 1    01:54:40    So when you lived with Paul Fout at the Pink House, that was bef right before you bought this place then?  
Speaker 0    01:54:46    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:54:47    So you'd come back from UVA li moved there and then moved here?  
Speaker 0    01:54:50    Well, actually father married Molly Wiley, Molly Lewis from Richmond, Herbert. Brian had been dating her. And I said, well, dad, isn't Herbert a friend of yours? Yeah. So, well, wasn't he dating Molly? He said, son, you see something you really like, go for it. That's all he said, <laugh>. And  
Speaker 2    01:55:22    Weren't they eng engaged? Were they engaged?  
Speaker 0    01:55:25    Huh?  
Speaker 2    01:55:25    Were they engaged?  
Speaker 0    01:55:27    I don't know. He just went out with her all the time.  
Speaker 3    01:55:30    I, <affirmative>  
Speaker 0    01:55:33    And Felda and I were in Idaho at Barbara Aries Ranch out there, which was six square sections being square mile the second. That was a beautiful place. And Eve called us and told us that father was getting married in Richmond  
Speaker 3    01:55:57    That weekend, <laugh>  
Speaker 0    01:55:59    This coming weekend. So I looked at f looked at me and he said, you know, we better get the adoption papers and get the hell in there and slip 'em under the paper. He said, I think you're right. So we hauled ass out an airplane and got out of there and drove. And we could only get into Baltimore. So Eve drove over to Baltimore and picked us up. We dropped her off in Middleburg and took the car on to Richmond and got to Molly's place.  
Speaker 3    01:56:34    I  
Speaker 0    01:56:35    And, uh, uh, we got there. The father had gone out and gotten a haircut. This guy just his all old knocks and shit. And his head was showing and we, well, everybody got to drinking and it was a fine time. We got there just in time. So he brought his bride back to the pink house and I said, FAL, this don't look good. We, it is awful credit in here. This woman ain't gonna put up with this belong <laugh> worth of money she's got. So  
Speaker 3    01:57:17    I  
Speaker 0    01:57:17    Making something wrong. They, uh, we uh, he came over and looked at this place and he looked at a couple places and he looked at this and bought this from Bridge. Victors. And  
Speaker 3    01:57:34    Paul did or your dad did?  
Speaker 0    01:57:36    My dad did. And we were the only the third people who ever owned this farm. Really? It was the original Land Grand Farm. And, uh, apparently the minister was a Presbyterian minister, Reverend Scott. And he was too well bred to kill him. So they shipped him to the New World and he managed to piss off the governor in Williamsburg. So he banned him up here to Northern Virginia, which was really nowhere with 15,000 acres.  
Speaker 3    01:58:18    Wow.  
Speaker 0    01:58:20    And that's why all the Scots last Scots buried out there in the, and then the last Scot was a female and she married Dr. Peyton. And that's where the Peyton name came in. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    01:58:37    Was that Lucinda? She was last one. I was like second grade. They had a service down there. Oh.  
Speaker 0    01:58:45    But, uh, of course you couldn't get a backhoe in there. And they were all buried. So they backed the truck up to the wall on the outside and he send the backhoe down and he could reach over and dig out a, a hole.  
Speaker 1    01:59:06    Did they, so the original land grant was to Scott and you bought it from, from them  
Speaker 2    01:59:14    The Vickers. Then the Vickers.  
Speaker 0    01:59:17    We bought it from the Vickers. The Vickers bought it from the Scott or the Peytons at that time. And they built a house in Warrenton. And uh,  
Speaker 1    01:59:32    Was it, it wasn't 15,000 acres, was it  
Speaker 3    01:59:35    <laugh>?  
Speaker 0    01:59:36    No, no. It was 345 when we bought it. All land had been sold off. And  
Speaker 2    01:59:41    You know where the Vickers didn't the Vickers end up moving to the house off St. Louis where Stormy and Jeff lived. That they rented? Yeah. Yeah. You know, near the training center.  
Speaker 0    01:59:50    Yeah. He went out and built that house.  
Speaker 2    01:59:52    He built that house, which is kind of funny.  
Speaker 1    01:59:54    That's funny. Circle a  
Speaker 0    01:59:55    Little bit. He wanted a modern house. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He had a brother that was killed in World War ii. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And the bedroom at the top of the stairs, all his clothes were still in there. And the bed was made and his clothes were laid out on the bed.  
Speaker 2    02:00:11    Is that Will's room now? Was the guest room? Yeah. It's cool in there. There's like old sketches on the wall that soldiers, 'cause it was a hospital over there.  
Speaker 0    02:00:21    Oh, that's in, that's in Elizabeth's room. I mean in  
Speaker 2    02:00:25    Elizabeth slash Molly. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    02:00:28    Yeah.  
Speaker 2    02:00:29    Um,  
Speaker 3    02:00:32    Yeah,  
Speaker 0    02:00:33    Through the Civil War, this traded heads two or three times. But there was big Army hospital down here in the plains. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 3    02:00:42    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    02:00:44    And a lot of the doctors stayed here. So, but the Vickers would go to Europe every summer and buy antiques. And Ridge didn't want anything to do with any of it. He'd married girl who followed the Rochester Road Company down in uh, tall Pepper. And he wanted a modern house. So he went over there and built that house next to the track.  
Speaker 2    02:01:18    But then he is uh, he's scattered in the yard, right? Huh? Did he wanna be buried here? Isn't he scattered in the yard when he died? He wanted to be his  
Speaker 0    02:01:27    Ashes here. Oh. They had their own cemetery down in front.  
Speaker 2    02:01:31    But Sam, the same one who farmed with him wouldn't mow for a long time. When he found out that Mr. Vickers was scouting.  
Speaker 0    02:01:37    I never told him that. I told him 'em, it was just some ceremonial stuff. 'cause I knew they wouldn't go in there if they thought it was just bones  
Speaker 3    02:01:45    <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    02:01:47    I lied a little bit, but it was better calls. Right. Uh, in  
Speaker 1    02:01:52    The name of work. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    02:01:53    Right. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    02:01:55    Get 'em to work a few more minutes.  
Speaker 2    02:01:57    Yeah. But don't tell 'em anybody's, I mean there's a lot of times of death might be altered a lot in the <laugh>. Right. That was all exciting. You know, Jason Bickers of the tennis club. I was like, no relation.  
Speaker 1    02:02:11    No relation.  
Speaker 0    02:02:12    But Ridge was a real character.  
Speaker 2    02:02:17    And was he alive when I was, I don't know. Did I know it? No.  
Speaker 0    02:02:22    I don't know. He used to go into, uh, New York Cafe and get a piece of pecan pie and go in the Safeway and buy a gallon of ice cream and sit there with a spoon in his pocket needed on the curb with the Peak Island pie.  
Speaker 2    02:02:43    Huh. I mean, if somebody did that today, you'd be like, what's wrong with that? Right. But  
Speaker 1    02:02:48    People walk around and eat all the time. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    02:02:51    Middleburg was a lot <affirmative>. Same a place in those days. <laugh>.

Speaker 0    02:02:59    Well you knew everybody in town. Yeah. Now you don't know anybody.  
Speaker 2    02:03:03    That was a trouble. We could have house charge accounts everywhere we went. It was a beautiful thing as a <laugh> growing up. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    02:03:12    But the BNA was my favorite place.  
Speaker 2    02:03:15    It was great.  
Speaker 0    02:03:16    I could could go in there with it. Alice Edwards every morning. And uh,

Speaker 0    02:03:32    Pork chop. And then, uh, bill, uh, oh, Mr. Fred, Mr. Roger, Fred, he would be down there in the morning and those two knew old news. You didn't need a newspaper. You could sit there and they'd fill you in on everything that had happened  
Speaker 2    02:03:55    In town or around the world.  
Speaker 0    02:03:58    The world was fiddle. Whatcha talking about?

Speaker 0    02:04:13    Grocery. They'd make you a sandwich if you wanted though.  
Speaker 2    02:04:16    Yeah. Was there a lot of segregation? Like black, white.  
Speaker 0    02:04:22    But blacks could go in there with no silver.  
Speaker 2    02:04:24    It was, yeah.

Speaker 1    02:04:30    They couldn't. Where could they eat anywhere?

Speaker 1    02:11:36    So when you got into it though, you went and you watched them and Yeah,  
Speaker 0    02:11:40    I'd go to Charlestown and if we had a horse that looked like it could win the race and take me as Wiley over there for dinner and we'd sit up in the, uh, in the, uh, place where you ate. Have a nice dinner and some drinks and we could bed right up the air.

Speaker 1    02:15:21    When did the swimming pool get adjoined to the training track?  
Speaker 0    02:15:25    Uh, that was built by somebody else. We didn't do that. We used to go down there and use the pond.  
Speaker 2    02:15:35    When did you get out of the training track?  
Speaker 3    02:15:38    Hmm?

Speaker 3    02:16:28    Hmm.  
Speaker 0    02:16:29    We had a fiberglass rail around the track, and this guy said we didn't need a rail. He took the train, you know, it just, he wrecked the place and then that big land developer bought it from him. And I tried to help him and he got a trifling son in there running it, who he can't figure out anything else to do with it. And so I just finally said the hell with it. I don't even like going in there anymore.  
Speaker 2    02:17:06    I mean, that was your day ever growing up? I mean, you were at the trek every morning. That's what you did, right?  
Speaker 0    02:17:12    I left here at five o'clock in the morning for 30 years.  
Speaker 1    02:17:19    Went over there. Now did you have other people's horses at that time that you were working in your barn?

I said, you want me to take it home and break it for you and everything? He said, sure, go ahead. He said, I'll give you the guy's number, he'll call you and you'll two call him. I said, uh oh. And this guy would call me at night from a payphone. Uh, that's all I'm gonna say. But the money was always on time.
