Title   Interviewed 1/30/20<br>by Lydia Strohl <https://d1q40j6jx1d8h6.cloudfront.net/Obituaries/23112665/Thumbnail.jpg>
Speaker 0    00:00:00    This oral history with Robert McDonald Young, who is called Sandy, and his wife Claudia Young, nay Saffer, S-A-F-F-E-R, was recorded on January 30th, 2020 at <105 East Washington Street @38.96967,-77.73350,18> in Middleburg, Virginia.  
Speaker 0    00:00:22    We are sitting in the <Emanuel Church Parish House https://www.emmanuelmiddleburg.org> on Washington Street in Middleburg, which is where you lived for part of your childhood. Yes. 
Speaker 1    00:00:32    Most of my childhood. Not  
Speaker 1    00:00:33    Most of your childhood. We  
Speaker 1    00:00:35    Lived on the other side of the street, midwife up the street before moving down here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I'll tell you about that later. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:00:44    You said you wanted to start at W Pen Creek. Yeah. And why is that?  
Speaker 1    00:00:48    And I have a footnote about w Bend Creek. Stanley Wills knew was the only cop in town, was married to another woman, and he was having an affair with a married woman. And my brother Stewart, happened to walk by and see his car in there. And he took the key and locked the gate and took the key and threw it in Walker, Penn Creek. It's probably there to this day, on the bottom of Walker Bed Creek Creek. And anyway, he, Stanley took the married lady and boosted him on her shoulder, and she got over the fence. And then she called somebody and said, I just walked by the old cemetery, which there was only one way in, and one way out through the main gate and said, I see that the town cop is there, Mr. Wilson is there. And so they went down to let him out.  
Speaker 1    00:01:43    And of course it was locked, so they had to saw the, uh, lock case in half and let him out. And they said, what were you doing in there, Stanley? He said, well, I heard that they're stealing marble grave stones. And he said, I wanted to make sure that they weren't stealing them, that they were in there. So he got out and that was it. And I'm sure the, as I said, the key is on the bottom, walk in Creek to this day, <laugh>. So we'll start on that side of the street and come up the street. Raymond Gordon lived in the house, the big house that is now painted white. It was natural brick before he moved. When he lived there, he made all the suits for men and women. And he also made the pink coats for the hunt, which are actually red. And the reason they're called pink is they were made by a George Pink in England, and he made 'em for the first hunt.  
Speaker 1    00:02:44    He lived in London. And he, um, so they named coats after him. That's why they're called pink coats, even though they're red. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So anyway, Raymond Gordon had more work than he could actually handled. He was busy all the time. And he was a wonderful, excellent tailor. And then next to him is the little brick house, which I think is painted white now. It used to be red. And, uh, a writer, an author by the name of Dickerson, lived there, can't remember his first name. Uh, we're all familiar with his books. I can't remember any of those. And he lived there for a long time. And then there was a little White House. I'm not sure if it's still there or not, that, um, oh gosh, what was his name? The black man that worked for Lewis Wiley. Mutts. Mutts, yes. Mut. Tibs lived, he had, was married and he had three daughters, um, two of which are around here. One is deceased.  
Speaker 1    00:03:53    And then there were, no, those townhouses were not there. And the brick house on the end, which has been painted in white. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I do not know who lives there. I don't think it was there when I was growing up. I think it was built later. Uh, up the back street, of course, was the Black Baptist Church and the house on the corner where, um, the Turners originally lived. And then they moved down here on the back street. Anyway, uh, then it was Confederate Hall, and Confederate Hall was moved to the Abel Smith's, uh, Mimi Abel Smith's mother actually moved it. And it stands today on Mimi Abel Smith's property, which she inherited from her mother. And it's the way it looked then. And where was it in? It was right where the Exxon station is. Okay. Okay. Next to that was Courtney Smith's house.  
Speaker 1    00:04:55    Courtney Smith's house. He was the mayor of Middleburg, and it's now the real estate office. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He, uh, had a koi pond and beautiful gardens with flowers in the back. Had a mint garden. Only person, I doubt I knew that had a mint garden. Then next to him was the Fletcher House. Mrs. Fletcher was a widow with three sons. Only one remains today. And he lives in Connecticut. Uh, next to that was the, uh, Leonard House. Um, buddy Leonard, Ms. Leonard later worked at the Gourmet Kitchen that, uh, once Dotson owned. But she, she was wonderful. She baked great cookies and things, which she'd give to us. And, uh, now it's, it's the, uh, McMahon office. Then next to that is the White House in the back that my mother and father lived in when they were first married. And there were blood stains on the hearth where somebody had been murdered, and they had to bleach those and get 'em up. Uh, Lynn and, um, can't think of his name, all of a sudden.  
Speaker 0    00:06:25    Royston  
Speaker 1    00:06:26    Lynn Royston. Yeah, Lynn, her husband Jerry, Jerry Wines live now the White House right there. Right. It's across. Right,  
Speaker 1    00:06:38    Right,  
Speaker 1    00:06:39    Right up the street a little bit <next @38.97108,-77.73065,19> to the funeral home. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. The funeral home was built. And Tyler Gore was the funeral director. He's now retired. He and Peggy Gordon. Peggy is the daughter of the Taylor that lived down at the end of town. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, Tyler's retired because he had lots of injuries and pain and whatnot. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But the Royans were there when you were Yeah. The Royans were little. My father was a doctor that lived here. My mother was a nurse, though. She never practiced 'cause she was too busy having babies and raising us. Anyway, um, Royston funeral home was always a funeral home. And my f as I said, my father was a doctor. And Norris Royston always joked and said that, uh, he got daddy's mistakes.  
Speaker 1    00:07:37    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:07:39    Then Ms. Mercer had the building next door, which is now two shops, but it was all one. And she had Emory Bendell Cosmetics. She had gifts, she had, um, clothes. She had just about everything. And she also had the little building behind it. And it was owned by, um, I'll get back to that. I remember, I, I can see her picture right now. Just the name escapes me. Gwen Dobson owned it when we were, no. Gwyn later bought it from and made it into two separate shops. Wait a minute. Um, Mary White was owned by Mary White, and she came in for lunch every day. And, uh, Ms. Mercer had, uh, a dog named Panal Hattie, which was a little Jones, Terry, with Flo Beers. It was a runt of the litter. And it went everywhere she went. And she would carry it in her pocketbook with her pocketbook open and this little head sticking out. And, uh, we had the best time. She would take me home with her for lunch and dinner. Well, more dinner. And she baked the best bread. And she would send me home with a loaf, take me home with a local bread. And where  
Speaker 0    00:09:12    Did she live?  
Speaker 1    00:09:12    She lived out of town. And then next to that was the, uh, house where we lived. The brick house, which is now, I think a thrift shop or something.  
Speaker 0    00:09:29    That's the one in the middle. Chloe's actually now.  
Speaker 1    00:09:32    Yeah. See there no buildings were there originally. Our property went all the way to the end of the street. It was a dirt road. And on Route 50, which had recently been pave, there were beautiful maple trees all up and down the road. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Anyway, um, we owned the property all the way back to back street, and it was just, as I said, dirt roads.  
Speaker 0    00:09:58    So it was like the whole block.  
Speaker 1    00:10:00    Yeah. Not the entire block, but most part of the block. Right. All the way to the back. You can see it from the picture. Yeah. We had a meat house. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We had, uh, wood, uh, shed. We had a barn. We had a feel, which we, uh, let, uh, Ms. Newton Colston, Newton, Ms. Colston Newton use, she had ponies, three ponies and three children. We all rode together. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, she lived at Stray Shot, which is where Turner Reuter is now. The, uh, you know, the big place He has the n Right. And then across from that was the, uh, lone Telephone Exchange. And Bessie Moore ran that. It was a switchboard in those days. We plugged in the phone.  
Speaker 0    00:10:58    When you say Lom, is it LO How do you spell that? Lom. The telephone exchange. The name of it.  
Speaker 1    00:11:04    It had no name. Oh, it, it was the only telephone exchange.  
Speaker 0    00:11:08    Oh, I thought you said it was  
Speaker 1    00:11:09    Loan. No, the only loan  
Speaker 1    00:11:12    Telephone. Oh, the loan. Oh, the loan. <laugh>. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:11:15    Had a, had a switchboard where you plugged in. Right. And if you're going somewhere, you'd call Bessie and you'd set Bessie, I'm gonna be out of town for three hours and we should take my messages. And she would, and I would go up there and sit with Bessie and she'd pour me a little craft cheese, glass full of beer. I mean, I was too young, way too young to drink <laugh>. And we'd sit there and we'd listen in on people's conversations.  
Speaker 1    00:11:39    So she was drinking beer and listening to people talk all day.  
Speaker 2    00:11:44    Listen, I was like, the town dog  
Speaker 1    00:11:46    <laugh>. So  
Speaker 1    00:11:52    Anyway, we, uh, did that. And then that later became, uh, when Greg Halve first came to town, the dentist. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Right. He used it as an office. And while his building was being built, and after him, uh, Bob McConnell used it until his building was being built, which was next door, which is now a part of the inn. Right. Of Turner's Inn. And then the deli was not there. And all those buildings weren't there. 'cause we owned all that property. Right open. Yeah. At Stonewall. We used to go to the end of the Stonewall and call across to the, uh, BNA and tell 'em, bring us a Pepsi Cola <laugh>. A bag of potato chips. Anyway, next to that was the little building that, uh, I think it's furniture in there now. Oh,  
Speaker 2    00:12:54    Shut every door in this place. And lock.  
Speaker 1    00:12:56    This is my husband, Sandy.  
Speaker 2    00:12:58    Hi, I'm Lydia Sandy on, how are you? Nice to see you. You made it. I should have locked out. Knocked on the window. God damnit. I didn't think you hear this soon. So,  
Speaker 0    00:13:10    So after that, the little brick house. The little brick house next to the movie theater, what was there originally? Was Grol there?  
Speaker 2    00:13:22    I, uh, if you look at the movie house from the street  
Speaker 1    00:13:27    Yeah. Next to it.  
Speaker 2    00:13:30    Well,  
Speaker 1    00:13:30    Next to where we lived, which later became, oh,  
Speaker 2    00:13:34    Well wait a minute. That was the, the, that was the, uh, uh, hardware.  
Speaker 1    00:13:40    No, the hardware. I'm gonna get to that where we lived in the White House, which is said, find Shop Now. Mark Hardware lived there. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he had three rings of keys. I mean, every known key in the world. And if you had a lock to a box or something, you'd take your box in there and he'd drive the key until he found it. And then he'd make a copy of the key and give it to you. Now, if you had something at your house, like a door you couldn't get, didn't have a key for, he'd bring those three rings to the house. And same thing. Make a key. Same thing. Yeah. And, uh, he was a nice guy. His daughter just recently died. He had one child, a daughter.  
Speaker 2    00:14:23    Can't think her name.  
Speaker 2    00:14:25    Theresa.  
Speaker 2    00:14:26    Huh?  
Speaker 2    00:14:26    Theresa.

Speaker 2    00:15:27    I was actually born in New York City, but, uh, we were living here and my mother didn't want to have any children in Washington DC for some reason. So, and that's where she was from. So she went back up and her, her family was, her mother and father were still living there. So we, uh, they  
Speaker 2    00:15:49    Were from England.  
Speaker 2    00:15:50    So she shipped up there. And I was born in New York and then shipped right back down here two weeks later. And been here ever since.

Speaker 1    00:16:05    Alright. Then next, next to that little, um, brick building was the Middlebrook Movie Theater. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Where the stone steps are. Right. And that was owned by, um, Lang Go Lan. Um,  
Speaker 1    00:16:26    Tip.

Liz, Liz Whitney, then, and incidentally, as a footnote, go with the Wind, made its debut here because it was directed, produced and paid for by Jock Whitney and Clark Gabel came. Huh. And he stayed a while, and he looked around to, for a farm to buy, but didn't end up buying one. But he came back frequently for visits along with Earl Flynn. Buster Keaton.  
Speaker 0    00:17:00    Who  
Speaker 1    00:17:00    Else? Jane Russell. Eddie Lamar.  
Speaker 1    00:17:04    Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:17:05    Judy Garland. They all came to Middleburg to visit at the movie theater. Daddy Simpson was the manager, and he had a, um, bulldog. And that bulldog went everywhere with him. Uh,  
Speaker 0    00:17:21    And they all came because, uh, Ms. Whitney was here. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:17:25    They asked her to be in New,  
Speaker 2    00:17:26    And  
Speaker 2    00:17:26    Jack and  
Speaker 2    00:17:27    Jock and Jock was, you know, financing movies at that time.  
Speaker 1    00:17:32    Right.  
Speaker 2    00:17:32    And also, he, uh, you know, he was Holly. He was a Hollywood type. He was also a very,  
Speaker 0    00:17:41    Uh, and Mrs. Whitney's who, uh, Mr. Wiley was working for, huh? Yes. Yes. Mr. Wiley was working for Mrs. Whitney.  
Speaker 2    00:17:48    Yes. Well, actually Louis' father,  
Speaker 2    00:17:51    Right? Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:17:52    Yeah. Uh, was, uh, came up here from, well, you got, you've already talked to him. So you know that story. When he came up here from Salem to work for, uh, Liz Whitney at the time. Right. Because she was divorced at the time. And then she married thereafter. Thereafter, thereafter,  
Speaker 1    00:18:15    <laugh>. But she brought a real Hollywood element to, to  
Speaker 1    00:18:19    Town. Yeah, she did.  
Speaker 1    00:18:21    And as a footnote, in those days, there was no lock on the women's bathroom. You could put your finger through the hole where the doorknob was, flick the hook and sneak in without pan. And I don't know why, but people beat on the floor. So you'd walk through, slush through the floor and leave tracks, and there was a big heater, oil heater. You went behind that and then got a seat, and the black people sat upstairs. Fred Lee Leonard, who lived across the street where McMahons are, did the projector. And it would often break. And we'd have to wait for him to splice it to continue the movie. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Okay. And he's dead now, also. Um, and was that, when you say the black people lived upstairs, was that a rule or was that Yeah, it was a rule. It was a rule. Things were segregated in those days. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. They sat upstairs. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Let me tell you something else. They would often spit down on the white people. Don't put that out there.  
Speaker 2    00:19:23    Well, I never, I never experienced that. I,  
Speaker 2    00:19:25    I didn't either. I  
Speaker 2    00:19:26    Sat too far up front.  
Speaker 2    00:19:28    <laugh> Me too. Stay  
Speaker 2    00:19:29    Outta range.  
Speaker 2    00:19:31    I don't know. I'm along Casty and Lone Range of movies. Friday nights, always a Western on Fridays. You  
Speaker 2    00:19:36    Lived right next to it. So, I mean, you went to Louis a lot. I, I didn't,  
Speaker 2    00:19:40    Yeah. I went Mondays and, and Mondays and Fridays in your brother's book. He said he went every Friday night. He did. To the Western. Every went every Western. And it was a cereal, so. Oh. Yeah. So you would know. And how long were those movies? Two hours, I guess. So they were the same amount of, of time, but they were cereals. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:19:59    I'm not sure that they were that long.  
Speaker 2    00:20:01    Yeah, they were, I think they were, uh, maybe an hour and a half, two  
Speaker 2    00:20:05    It, because they were part of a, the, the, it was the cereal and then the movie was shown. So the cereal was probably 20 minutes. The movie was whatever hour and, you know,  
Speaker 2    00:20:16    Days. Right. I don't remember. Right. Before they had so many previews. I remember when I was little, they used to shark show cartoons. That was the best part of the movie. They did too. Yeah. Um, but that, those were the good old days. Uh, and a lot of the movie stars came back frequently. That's how Robert Deval ended up here. Is that so? Yeah. Uh, and Fred Aire, who lived out on the, the, you know, out of the plains, he had, well his  
Speaker 2    00:20:46    Sister lived  
Speaker 2    00:20:47    Here. He and Adele. That's right. They moved here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But what happened happened was, um, Robert Deval came and fell in love with a local girl, married her, they later divorced. Now he's married to somebody else and does, did just tango lessons at his house and everything. And has dances frequently and allows people fishing his pond. Uh, and not too long ago, somebody had a drone flying over his house, tried to take pictures, and Jennifer Youngman, who lives across the road, said, get that drone down. And they said no. She went and got a shotgun and shot it down. They never reported her. They left. How  
Speaker 2    00:21:32    Did we get to that?  
Speaker 2    00:21:34    Anyway, just a footnote. <laugh>. So, uh, uh, anyway, when, when Robert Deval played Boo Ratley and To Kill a Mockingbird, that's when he came here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And bought the place he has now on the planes. Oh, he came when that movie was shown afterwards. Yeah. Uh, and he has his place in the plains, and he still making movies and he still travels back and forth. And he still has tango lessons, still has dances at his house, all that now wearing of theater. And then, then the Red Fox Tavern, which had a porch on it originally in the front. Yes. Which is now gone. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Ms. Gasaway owned it. I'd go every afternoon to have tea with her. Uh, she was a lovely lady. And she gave me, I still have it to this day, a, a white China boot, high top boot with black laces with pansies in it. And she had the best food.  
Speaker 2    00:22:35    Who are you talking about?  
Speaker 2    00:22:36    Ms. Gasaway. Um huh. Ms. Gasaway, who owned the Red Fox.  
Speaker 2    00:22:42    Yeah. You know, you get in stuff now that goes beyond  
Speaker 2    00:22:44    Me then, which  
Speaker 2    00:22:46    I can add to this  
Speaker 2    00:22:47    <laugh>, then the Colonial Inn, which also had a porch. And it was painted white. Had two dining rooms. They served meals. Mabel Waddell ran it first, her mother. And then when she mother died, Mabel took it over. Uh, they had two cooks, two dining rooms. They had a big community table. They had upstairs. They had, um, paying guests that stayed there all the time. My father stayed there when he first came to town. Um, dual Tyler stayed there. And, uh, Mercer, Raymond. Mercer stayed there until they settled. I'll tell you about Raymond Mercer as we go up the street then. So now we're in the brick building across from the Red Fox. From the Red Fox. Okay. Right. And down that side street. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. The little house behind the Red Fox was part of the Red Fox. Right. Um, the big building there in the corner where Mosby's Tavern was. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:23:54    What do you, I've lost you because you're talking slow.  
Speaker 2    00:23:57    Mosby's Tavern.  
Speaker 2    00:23:59    Uh, the, well, Mosby's Tavern, the original one was right behind the Red Fox. Right. It was a real small building. You could squeeze maybe 40 people in there, and you, and had just had a, they turned it into a bar, and then they had a room in the back where you could eat and a little room off at. And that was at, and it was part of the parking lot. And then when, uh, Reuters wanted to enlarge Mosby's, he went across the street, which used to be a Deering Chevrolet. And that building, he bought and remodeled it. Put a big bar in there and a great big room in the back for where you could have dinners, dances. I mean, he made it sort of a, uh,  
Speaker 2    00:24:59    Oh, inclusive  
Speaker 2    00:25:00    All purpose. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Entertainment Place. Uh, but that store, that, that building behind and that building, I think it's still there behind the Red Fox. Yeah. I, they don't use it for anything except I think  
Speaker 2    00:25:17    They have room overflow. I think they have rooms in there.  
Speaker 2    00:25:19    They may have rooms in there now.  
Speaker 2    00:25:21    And of course, the school house was, is next door. Yeah. Behind the, the, uh, straight Fox General Reuters. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, in those days, they only had three teachers, or to four teachers. Um, they also had a dollhouse, which we donated. I think that's been destroyed in the first grade, in the kindergarten room, first grade room, rather. Uh, then, uh, the next to, uh, Mosby's Tavern, the little brick building. Who was there? Go that way. It's Stone building is a stone building. It's a stone building to, as you're looking at Mosby's, it's to the left.  
Speaker 2    00:26:14    The left. It's now an architecture, or at least it was.  
Speaker 2    00:26:17    Right? Yes, you're right. Do you remember who was there originally?  
Speaker 2    00:26:24    I'll tell you one thing. It's stretch of my memory. I do remember who was in there, but I cannot bring it as name up now. Uh, it was like a private office. And, uh, and then they had, uh, there was, I, there were two architects in there, one or two anyway. And I don't know who's in there now, to tell you the truth, I don't pay any attention.

Uh, and that tack shop was the original desk, floor, dining room, whatever. Because it, you know, there's a lot of space. Right. Um, so I don't know what's in there. I mean, I, all I see is stuff in the window, but I don't know what, what it is.

Um, anyway, Charlotte was a great seamstress and Buddy was a mechanic, and they're both deceased. And now it's a lingerie shop, I think. And then Anderson Sandwich Shop, they were open for lunch and dinner. And

Speaker 2    00:30:15    Liquor Store wasn't there? No, originally  
Speaker 2    00:30:17    The liquor store was on the back. On the back street.  
Speaker 2    00:30:19    Yeah. Liquor Store wasn't there originally.  
Speaker 2    00:30:23    I don't know where, where you're going with this. So I don't want to get  
Speaker 2    00:30:26    Interrupted. I'm going up the street, up that side of the street. Oh, I skipped Dr. Spitler, excuse me. The Colonial Inn. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Then Dot Stables had their, their shop, which took up where, um, the thrift shop is, and the, and the ice cream shop is, she had three people working for and later wore Maribel Clark being one of them. She has, she's on the side street now. Uh, and what kind of shop was that? Hair? It was hair and nails.  
Speaker 2    00:30:59    I remember there was a drugstore there too.  
Speaker 2    00:31:02    What did I skip the, I hadn't gotten to the drugstore yet. Drugstore is next. Brad Shaw's drugstore. Yeah. Next to the nail hair and nail. Right Where the Gourmet Kitchen, kitchen Gourmet was Uhhuh. <affirmative>. Yes. Yeah. Next to that was Dr. Spitler house. He owned the, where the Safeway is. He owned the whole block.

And the, the Sway bought it and built the Safeway did a poor ass job of it. They didn't build parking big enough. They didn't build a store big enough. And they didn't build a loading dock big enough, the area to drive into it. Anyway, next then, um, nothing on the back street yet, then

Speaker 2    00:34:49    At Community Center. Community Center.  
Speaker 2    00:34:52    Well,  
Speaker 2    00:34:53    And Hal Jackson bought the property,  
Speaker 2    00:34:56    You know, a little off face there on Jackson Center's barn. That's, I I, I worked in there. It's, it was further into <inaudible> near the house. You talking about? About a street over from, from where the library is. You get into Virginia Street and that area. There was that one of those, you can't see it now because there's, there's nothing left of it. But there was a big old house there. And in town barn, it wasn't very big. And that's where they kept Sty. And they used to take him out the back street in the back of Ridgeview and Gal. And those great big fields were Salamander. S Sp is now Right. All the way up  
Speaker 1    00:35:42    Through there. All the way up through there. He was Ty.  
Speaker 2    00:35:45    Huh? He was Ty. He was a famous race horse. Race horse, uh, that, uh, Hearst Jacobs trained in New York, and they used to send him down to Jack Skinner for conditioning. R and r Uhhuh.  
Speaker 1    00:35:56    What did he win that made him famous? Huh? What did he win that made him famous?  
Speaker 2    00:36:01    Well, you know, I've got the book at home and I can't, usually I'm pretty good on all that stuff. But they were, they were big New York races. Summers still in the existence. Uh, but he was, uh, he was a gelding. And, uh, this trailer in New York, Hearst Jacobs, who was famous in his own right. Uh, I can't remember the lady's name who owned him. But long story short, he became part of this area's lore. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. When he was here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, uh, that whole area of Ridgeview used to be a little more open. Uh, when I say open, it just wasn't as, you didn't have back to back. It's like you got back.  
Speaker 1    00:36:53    Right. Right. And Jack Skinner was a local trainer.  
Speaker 2    00:36:57    Yeah. And he and my father were very close friends. They actually rode together as amateur, steep chase riders. Um, and then Jack went to training, uh, when he retired from riding. And, uh, he, uh, he ended up, uh, with a barn at Paul Mellon's, uh, where the training center is now. Right. Training center is Right.  
Speaker 1    00:37:32    Where was your house when you were growing up?  
Speaker 2    00:37:35    Same place I am now. Same farm, but, uh, the big house. Right. Uh, which we called it, um, is out, uh, is on Young Road, out of the little road. Have you been out in that area? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Okay. So I grew up in, in that, in that big, in that big house. Um, Denton Farm. The what? Denton farm? Yeah. Well, it was called, it was just called Denton in those days. Right.  
Speaker 2    00:38:04    And then we changed it. Then when I came back here to work in 1965, I used Denton Farm as a business so that I could get feed hay, you know, I just, instead of charging it to the family and set up a, a farm account. So when my family died and my brother moved back here, he didn't know. I said, I'm keeping the farm since I'm still only one here working a farm. The farm name Deton Farm. And so Phil Thomas of all people suggested my brother called it Old Deton. So since 1980 something, my father died in 80. So it's that, that part of the prop, that part of the farm was called Old Denton. And as it has been transferred since that's, it's been transferred as old Denton,  
Speaker 2    00:39:12    We we're Denton where we live, right across the across  
Speaker 1    00:39:16    Ton. The old Denton was just recently sold again. Yes. Oaky Turner sold it. Yes. Again, to,  
Speaker 2    00:39:21    I got a lot of stuff from Mokey, much to send Nevermind. <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:39:29    Anyway. Not your,  
Speaker 2    00:39:30    Anyway, um, we built a house up on the hill. Uh, they gave us some property. We built a house up on the hill.  
Speaker 1    00:39:38    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And when was that?  
Speaker 2    00:39:40    65.  
Speaker 1    00:39:41    65. So that's the house then you grew up in? Yes. Yes. Yeah. That there's still in. And then we built a house on the hill too. Right. <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:39:50    Go back, build another one. If I had another hill, I'd probably build one for the rest of them.  
Speaker 1    00:39:56    <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:39:58    Well, actually,  
Speaker 2    00:39:59    We didn't build that. They built  
Speaker 1    00:40:00    Their own.  
Speaker 2    00:40:00    Mary B's gonna move in, remodel the tenant house to move in there in one of these days.  
Speaker 2    00:40:05    Well, no, that's going, that's

Speaker 2    00:40:10    Hers too. It's going, that house is going in one place in the ground.  
Speaker 2    00:40:16    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:40:17    So you two met here as children, right?  
Speaker 2    00:40:21    In this practically in this room.  
Speaker 1    00:40:22    Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:40:24    Um, yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:40:25    And my father was his doctor. He'd come for allergy shots.  
Speaker 1    00:40:29    <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:40:30    I didn't have any interest in him whatsoever. I used it to take all of our, my girlfriends, myself, to the movies in Winchester. He'd pay for all of us, buy us popcorn and Coca-Cola or Pepsi's. He had a convertible, good looking. His mobile with was black with red leather interior and white top and a hood ornament.  
Speaker 2    00:40:56    Well, that's why I had that in college. I didn't have that when I first met you.  
Speaker 2    00:41:00    Oh, you had the Plymouth Ray. Plymouth.  
Speaker 2    00:41:02    I had some whatever I could borrow from the old man <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:41:07    He, we were at the drugstore one day where Ms. Leonard worked. And, uh, I was on a stool and he came in and he, during the stool round, he said, would you go with me to the Millwood Country Club dance Saturday night? I said, no. And he turned around and he said, reconsider. And I said, no. And the slightest interest in going to the dance, or you Sandy, um, give up, get a life. And he turned that stool around. And he looked at me and he said, I'll never give up. I'm gonna marry you one of these days. I mean, we were 14 years old. Mind you and Ms. Leonard. I  
Speaker 2    00:41:47    Remember that  
Speaker 2    00:41:48    Now. I did. Ms. Leonard was there, and they all started applauding. I was so embarrassed. I turned red. Me do. Anyway, that's what happened. <laugh> <laugh>, the beginning  
Speaker 1    00:42:00    Of the end. Yeah. And you were here until, and then went away for college.  
Speaker 2    00:42:06    I was here. And then I went away to, um,  
Speaker 2    00:42:10    Aiken.  
Speaker 2    00:42:11    I'm trying to see, I think how old we were. I, I, I don't know if I was driving.  
Speaker 2    00:42:17    You went to Aiken?  
Speaker 2    00:42:18    Well, I went to Aiken. Yeah. I went, I went away to school, to Aiken when I was 10 years old. Um, which is South Carolina. Very small private school.  
Speaker 2    00:42:30    Still has friends from Aiken.  
Speaker 2    00:42:32    Huh.  
Speaker 2    00:42:33    Prep still has friends from Aiken Prep. You still have friends from Aiken Prep? Oh, yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:42:39    Yeah. Ones are still kicking. Um, I was there for four years and I went to school in Connecticut and was there for five years. I had a gap year there. And I went from there to University of Virginia and all told, I was there for five years off and on. But I was also in the Army, but active for six months. And when I came out, uh, I went to, uh, the university extension up in, uh, Arlington. And at that time, my mother had an apartment in Washington. This was 19 60, 61. Uh, my mother had an apartment at Washington, which was very convenient. 'cause night school was only three days a week. So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then long weekend. Uh, I used to come out here and ride a lot. Uh, just do a lot of things.  
Speaker 1    00:43:45    And what was your father's business at  
Speaker 2    00:43:48    Denton? Well, I'll tell you the truth. Uh, he had, he worked, he, he was in the horse business in one way or another as a rider. And then he, when, when his great uncle bought a farm, bill Langley on a to road down here,  
Speaker 2    00:44:07    Which John Warner later bought.  
Speaker 2    00:44:10    Yeah. Well, don't, don't get ahead of the game here. Um, he came down and he had a big fox hunting barn. When I say barn, I mean he, it was, he had 30 or 40 horses. So my father came down and, uh, I guess it was about 1932 or 33. 'cause he and my mother were married in 33. That's right. And then they came down here and he went to work for Bill Langley. And basically he was running that whole operation, which is quite an operation. And when, when you fox something five days a week, sometimes six, and you're sending out 12 horses from your barn. I mean, it was, they, and they, no trailers. They hacked everyone.  
Speaker 2    00:45:06    They hacked them,  
Speaker 2    00:45:08    Hacked, act everywhere. And they'd leave depending on where it was gonna be that day and how far it took long to get there. They'd leave maybe an hour, hour and a half before they get home. After dark, sometimes way after dark.  
Speaker 1    00:45:23    And who were their clients at that time? Was it local people or was it people  
Speaker 2    00:45:28    From dc Well, they were mainly, there were no clients per se. Bill Langley was very wealthy, so he just provided horses for people who wanted to ride. But were they local  
Speaker 2    00:45:39    People  
Speaker 6    00:45:40    Or were they people that came, were they local people here in middle?  
Speaker 2    00:45:43    Some were local. Some came from New York and spent a week here and he'd provide the horses.  
Speaker 2    00:45:49    And he had airplane flew and landed on the property. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 2    00:45:53    <affirmative>. Um, well, he didn't have it at that time because he didn't get the plane flew much later. But, um,  
Speaker 2    00:46:02    So you're saying he didn't charge them, he would just Right. Five.  
Speaker 2    00:46:05    Yeah. Uh, and then, uh, the family moved over to where? Bill, uh, Barbara and Bill Scott Wilson. Now Scott lives, uh, which is right, very close to us where we live now. And, um, they lived there for right before they bought Denton, the farm, or Bill. Andy bought it for him. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he set him up there with, so my father really never had, per se, a paying job. He, uh, he was fortunate he was well.  
Speaker 2    00:46:53    And, uh, let me tell you something, footnote about the house. That big house stent in the farm, they had hand painted wallpaper in the dining room. Um, Ivy Vines with, uh, birds in it. Really pretty gone now. And I wish they'd saved part of it and framed it at least. But they didn't Okie, when he, they moved in and remodeled the house, which they did a good job. Anyway, we're gonna move up the street.  
Speaker 2    00:47:23    What?  
Speaker 2    00:47:23    Gonna move up the street?

Speaker 2    01:05:25    Know name's going right outta my  
Speaker 5    01:05:27    Mind. Mine too.  
Speaker 2    01:05:28    You talk to two dementia type here.  
Speaker 5    01:05:30    So you, uh, you're doing pretty well. I think <laugh>  
Speaker 2    01:05:35    <laugh>. Well, we're stumbling a lot.  
Speaker 1    01:05:38    When were you, you were both at the Hill School?  
Speaker 2    01:05:40    Well, I was very there very shortly, short time, because I don't even think I made it through full. I think I made it through first grade. But then we were shipped out to Kansas. 'cause my father was in the Army. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So we were shipped out to Manhattan, Kansas. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I went to school out there for I think two years before he was transferred to Louisiana. And my mother and brother and nanny moved back to the farm. And then I was shipped to Stuyvesant School in Warton, which was a boarding school. It was a, it was a like a five day boarding school. But you could stay, in my case, I stayed all seven days 'cause there was nobody at home. My mother went back out to ca one. She went, yeah, she went back out to, uh, I guess went to Louisiana for a short period of time. And my brother stayed at home here with a nanny.  
Speaker 1    01:06:52    And your, your brother is younger than you? Huh? Your brother was younger than you? Yeah.  
Speaker 2    01:06:56    He's five years younger. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    01:06:57    <affirmative>. And his, what's his name? Hmm? What's his name?  
Speaker 2    01:07:01    James. James. James. L Jimmy.  
Speaker 5    01:07:03    Jimmy.  
Speaker 2    01:07:04    Uh,  
Speaker 5    01:07:05    He's dead.  
Speaker 2    01:07:06    He died in, uh, he died about five years. Well, guess Bone one had didn't.  
Speaker 5    01:07:11    That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Probably six.  
Speaker 2    01:07:15    He had a very, he had the same disease that my father had, which was emphysema on top of, well, COPD type. Uh, and he contracted it. And he, when they sold the place, the big house and moved over to Marshall, uh, the house they were in was completely rigged with oxygens. That's where we just had one room for her. He had one go, he went all over. He had something like, I don't know, 500 feet of tubing, <laugh>. So he lived on oxygen 24 hours a day and was continually in the hospital for it. I don't know how we got off the subject. Oh  
Speaker 5    01:08:03    Yeah. So you went to, you were Asst Hill School, so you only went there were one year. Oh,  
Speaker 2    01:08:07    Yeah. Until  
Speaker 5    01:08:07    You went to Kansas.  
Speaker 2    01:08:08    Now they got me in the same class with her. I think it's just, I've told 'em, I did a, I didn't graduate and B 1952 I was in, uh, uh, I don't know where I was in 52, but I, I wasn't at Hill School, but they put me in the class. They never moved it just because I married to her  
Speaker 2    01:08:28    <laugh> <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:08:30    And you went to Hill School for longer than that. I see.  
Speaker 2    01:08:33    Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, actually they didn't have enough students for the third grade, or second or third grade. I can't third, I think. And Kathy, Mel and I went to the public school here in Middleburg for one year. Now, my brother Dopp started at Hill and there weren't any boys in his class. So he asked the family if he could go to public school. So they let him go to the public school mm-hmm <affirmative>. So he could have some companionship. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he went with Wesley Boxwell who, uh, became his best friend. Wesley was a jack of all trade. There wasn't anything he couldn't do. He would, he was a wonderful photographer and a chemist. He was always mechanic chemist. He was always experimenting with the chemistry set. So Wonder didn't blow the house up in our basement. And he became head of security at Mellons, all Mellons directing and assigning the other, uh, security people where to go and what to do. And he checked on, kept on top of things. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he was there until he died recently. And his widow still lives here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Out of town.  
Speaker 2    01:09:57    Well, actually he had retired before, before he died. Uh, but he did do peace piece me. He did piecemeal work up there.  
Speaker 2    01:10:06    Yeah. He was sick.  
Speaker 2    01:10:07    If they were needed, if they needed, you know, a fill in or they needed Right. Something covered. Right. Um, it was, the Lawrences from Marshall were sort of the head of that, well, along with Wesley. Uh, but when you think of what they had to cover with the airport and Mr. Mellon flying in and out, and Ms. Mellon taking over the rest of the, you know, the gardens and everything, they were spread out pretty thin. Kathy  
Speaker 2    01:10:41    Went to work for up there. They treated her like a royalty. <laugh>.  
Speaker 5    01:10:46    Well, let's get back to middle burn <laugh>. I worry about you guys a middle. I was gonna say, yeah. Late <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    01:10:54    I'm gonna cut you loose here in the middle. Is  
Speaker 2    01:10:56    There anything else? I think, oh,  
Speaker 2    01:10:57    I'm sure there is, but Oh God,  
Speaker 2    01:10:59    Come down the street. Well, if  
Speaker 5    01:11:00    Dad wants to leave, maybe she can ask Dad, and you can stay for a few minutes.  
Speaker 2    01:11:05    Um,  
Speaker 5    01:11:05    If she needs to know anything else,  
Speaker 1    01:11:08    Tell me, um, what you did then, when you said you came back to Middleburg in 65, was that after you were at UVA?  
Speaker 2    01:11:15    No, that was after I'd been working in New York. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. When I, we got married in New York, in Saratoga, and I was working for the New York Racing Association at the time. I got, I had gotten that job in March. And, uh, they told me when they hired me that they had just hired somebody else two weeks ahead of me, and they worked on a seniority program there. So they said, look, it's a possibility after, after Saratoga meet you, you, you may, you're the bottom man, so you're the, you're the one that gets dropped. Anyway, I was New York working for the New York Race Association, and then, um, my, uh, we got married in Saratoga in 1962, and that was the last meet of my tenure there.  
Speaker 2    01:12:16    I came, I had rented a house in Long Island before we were married. Uh, so when we came back from Saratoga, at least, we had a place to live. And I got a job in New York with what is known as the Jockey Club, which is the ruling body overall race, hand breeding. And I was there from, let's see, we got married in August of 62. I was there from August, well, September of 62 until January of 65. Um, and we moved once when she was born. Um, and then I'm, I moved back down here. Well, actually, just to go back, I, I was, they were considered me for another post up there. And my mother came up one weekend and pulled out the crying towel and said, you gotta come back home. The place is going to hell in a handbag. Well, it really wasn't, but my father had a little problem and she, she wanted somebody to run the place. So it was, it was basically another hunter bar. Like my father started a hundred years before. And, uh, they said, we'll build you a house. So that's what they did. We went across the street, I tell you, living in New York and building a house in Virginia and not having any control, you know, so it was a good project. <laugh>. Well, it was a challenge, I can tell you that. It turned out well, though. Yeah, it out pretty good. I don't how that was got done. But anyway, you had a lot of chief,  
Speaker 2    01:14:16    Uh, Ms. Skinner, Ms. Jack Skinner gave us the plans. She'd just built tags. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she gave us the plans, and we just, uh, had an architect pitched the roof and put it upstairs. The bedrooms and bathrooms there.  
Speaker 2    01:14:30    Yeah. We had a little bit here and there,  
Speaker 2    01:14:32    So,  
Speaker 2    01:14:32    So that's how I came back. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:14:35    And then once you came back, you worked  
Speaker 2    01:14:36    In, so I was, I was actually working for the family. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 2    01:14:40    <affirmative>. And then Lee  
Speaker 2    01:14:41    Advertising, and then I bought into Lee Advertising, which is fun. And Lee's mother, uh, she had a partner and her partner wanted to quit. So, and I had been working in the same type of business in New York for the Jockey Club registration work and advertising work and stuff like that. So I had been doing some work for her on, as freelance registering horses at different farms. And then she said, would you, would you like to take over the so and so's? Can't remember girl's name now. And the partnership. And so I bought into it. So I was doing farm work first thing in the morning, advertising work till about three 30 or four back on the farm, make it hay. And, uh, so that's, that wasn't until 1977. And I sold out, uh, the Lee advertising thing 'cause mm-hmm <affirmative>. They had, we had moved from a old house up here, uh, Hitcher Post, uh, back to that where popcorn is now.  
Speaker 1    01:16:02    Oh yeah.  
Speaker 2    01:16:03    Uh, and we moved in there and I was there until 77. And I've been fiddling with horses and retired ever since. <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:16:14    And what, um, your barn did? Hunters. Huh? Your barn. Barn Did Hunters  
Speaker 2    01:16:22    Your barn?  
Speaker 2    01:16:22    Oh, yeah. But, but, well, at first, uh, and then when my, uh,  
Speaker 2    01:16:35    I'm trying to think. When my father died, I built a barn on my side of the road, and I still did. I had a couple hunters, but what I was really getting into was commercial breeding and selling at sales. Not high rent sales, unfortunately, but sales, that's what it is. Right. So for the last 50 or 20 years, I was, I was mainly in the breeding business, and I stopped riding really, uh, about when I was about 56, uh, just because I was getting involved in the breeding business and selling s and raising 'em there and folding 'em there. And I had, you know, a couple guys working for me. And, uh, I did the same thing over at the other farm. Uh, I, I got the family into the breeding business, got into the cattle, also got into the cattle businesses. So that's what I did the last 20 years. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Until I hung up my tax, so to speak.  
Speaker 1    01:17:42    And what were your horses? Was, uh, a specialty?  
Speaker 2    01:17:47    No, not really. They were thoroughbreds. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But, uh, they were fox hunters, and then they were brood mares. And then, uh, I had a couple horses that I kept after. Uh, they were fold. I had 'em broken and then put 'em on the racetrack. And so I got into the racing business on a small way. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Until when everything went lame and a heartbeat. So when I looked up one day and all was, there was an old retired bird, ma had bone ships, and, uh, she was too old to breed anymore. So I said, that's it, <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    01:18:26    But then I started renting the barn out, so that's where I got some other, that's where we got some other income. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Started off small and ended up renting out pasture. Uh, I also sold a big chunk of the farm in 2006, which helped me be able to do some of that stuff. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then, uh, but I've been, barn has been empty and a now for three years. It's not that I didn't, wouldn't want to put somebody in there, but I got some maintenance I gotta do before that. And right now I've got a few other things. <laugh> on the docket. Keeping  
Speaker 1    01:19:08    You busy. Yeah. Was there a, a certain time when the horse business changed so that it, it wasn't as easy to be in?  
Speaker 2    01:19:26    Well, I think you got it in different levels. Uh, I'm sure Louis told you a lot about this because, and I worked a lot with him. Uh, not only were we good friends, but we came business partner, uh, on, we would, we would buy horses in Kentucky and bring them back here and then sell 'em as either yearlings or, uh, or as two year olds. And we did quite a bit of that off and on. Um, he also sold stuff for me, uh, that I had raised as a nation, uh, when he was heavy into that. Um, so to answer your question, I, I can't really put a, a time when you can always get in it. So whether you could stay in it and, and say if you're at different levels, if you at the king in Saratoga level, you know, you, you pretty much got a hold on everything. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So I sold most of my stuff in Pennsylvania and Maryland. I had two or three that we sold in Kentucky. Two, the partnership and one of my own mm-hmm <affirmative>. But, uh, I liked all that. I really did. It's just when I, when I ran out of stock, uh, I didn't have the wherewithal to get back into it.  
Speaker 1    01:20:56    And is there still as much interest here, do you think, in, in terms of the business? Or how has the business changed here since you were in it?  
Speaker 2    01:21:03    I think, yeah, there's a lot of interest here. It's just some new people can't quite get ahold of it. A lot of people come in here and they build, buy these places, and then there's some nice farms, and then they find out what's involved. If they're not already acquainted with a horse business, I'm talking about complete ne neo flights. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, they don't usually buy real big places, but they buy, you know, big enough to where they find out that, my God, we got plow snow. We can't call the state or the city or the town or wherever. But interest wise and everything else, it may, I mean, I've got two people next to me that are pretty heavy in the horse business. Uh, one very successful. Uh, so, um, yes, I would say that, uh, there's still a lot of interest in, in that business.  
Speaker 1    01:22:09    And has the, uh, emphasis changed in the horse business here?  
Speaker 2    01:22:15    I, yeah. It's changed a little bit. Uh, some of the new people, uh, got into it because they lived somewhere and they, you know, they went to the races and they saw something mm-hmm <affirmative>. So they decided, so, uh, it may, that it may not be as many or, or as big mm-hmm <affirmative>. Like got, don't have Paul Miller anymore. Don't have Steve Clark anymore. So some of that era of people haven't really been replaced.  
Speaker 1    01:22:53    Replaced. Right.  
Speaker 2    01:22:53    Uh, in great numbers. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Here and there.  
Speaker 1    01:22:57    So when you were coming into the drug store and declaring your love, was that, um, you would, would set times that you would come back? Uh, no.  
Speaker 2    01:23:09    That's, I was like, fif 14, 15 years old.  
Speaker 1    01:23:12    So you would be at school and then come here in the summer?  
Speaker 2    01:23:15    Yeah. Um, exactly Right. Come back here. Uh, work on the farm this summer. Sometimes I had summer school. Sometimes, uh,  
Speaker 2    01:23:29    You worked for Darlington.  
Speaker 2    01:23:30    I also, I worked, uh, I worked at, uh, the Middleburg training center for, uh, a couple different trainers. Uh, Jack Skinner being one of 'em, Sidney Waters being unknown. Uh, I did that on, uh, summer, some summers. Um, other summers. I was in summer school, <laugh>, um, I guess more or less until I got out of college. Well, got outta the Army and then got outta college permanently. Then I started, you know, going to New York and stuff  
Speaker 1    01:24:19    Like that. Right.  
Speaker 2    01:24:22    But basically when I was in school, I'd be, I'd come home for vacations in the summertime. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    01:24:28    <affirmative>. And what else would you do in the, uh, days that you didn't have school or the evenings besides go to the movies? What kinds of things did you guys do socially?  
Speaker 2    01:24:40    A lot of dances.  
Speaker 1    01:24:41    You were there?  
Speaker 2    01:24:43    Uh,  
Speaker 2    01:24:44    A  
Speaker 2    01:24:44    Lot. I thought there were a lot, but there  
Speaker 2    01:24:48    Were quite a few  
Speaker 2    01:24:50    Wonderful pictures of us dancing together. Huh. We have wonderful pictures of us dancing together. Oh,  
Speaker 2    01:24:55    We do have that.  
Speaker 1    01:24:57    And where were those?  
Speaker 2    01:24:58    Community center mostly. And, uh, what was the old man that used to drive us? He called it, man,  
Speaker 2    01:25:08    I drove. You didn't drive me.  
Speaker 2    01:25:11    He lived on the back street.  
Speaker 2    01:25:15    Had that wonderful car.  
Speaker 2    01:25:19    You probably rode ponies and stuff like that. Uhhuh. <affirmative>. Yeah. I rode ponies. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Had a pony car that Steve Clark, uh, Jane Clark gave to us. And, uh, it was a basket cart. Loved it. And the pony was strictly for driving. Used to have loads you all up, drive around the fields and on the back rows. And I was driving one day and Che Lee's wife came by and she said, that's my car. I'm taking it. And she took it right then and there, plus the reins. And Jane Clark had given it to us. I don't know whether it was hers or not, but anyway, she took it. Well,  
Speaker 2    01:25:57    She wouldn't have given it to you otherwise. 'cause she's too, too nice a lady. <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    01:26:01    Exactly.

Speaker 2    01:32:47    And then next to that was where the original Safeway was. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, Mr. Boxwell, Wesley Boxwell father, I can't remember his first name, was the manager of the store. They didn't have a whole lot mm-hmm <affirmative>. It wasn't that big, but it was.

And they lived up in, in Ridgeview in the brick house, uh, next to where Tim built his house. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Next to, um, the sporting gallery. And next to the New York Cafe, which had swinging doors. We weren't allowed to go in, but my Uncle Campbell used to come and, uh, spend a week with us, or longer in the summer. And he'd go every afternoon and go up and have a beer at the New York Cafe. And he'd bring us back. Ice cream cones. Chocolate ice cream. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.

That what? We had an Uncle Campbell. Oh yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:34:22    That's, that's how we got Campbell. I'm sitting, you're texting with her. As a matter of fact, right now, she's done interview  
Speaker 2    01:34:27    And then coming down the street, um, let's see, uh, next to the New York Cafe was Poston. Herman Post's gas, Exxon gas station and country music used to stop there. They were playing for Maryland. Patsy Klein. Hmm. Um, Eddie Arnold. Um, and they would play there. Yeah. Play there. At the gas station.

And even if you needed something from the liquor store, she'd send somebody in the liquor store pick up for you. And you charged it and you just drove up to the corner and beat your, and they'd bring it out and load in your car. Those were the good old days. Right. Then the church, which is right here, then, uh, us right here.  
Speaker 2    01:36:59    And then next door was, um, Charles Den, who had the later had, uh, the hardware store. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And Charles, young Charles works at Mellons now. See him from time to time. We called him Bu in those days. And down here we sat on the other side of the fence and threw apples and called the Turners who lived on the corner niggers. And my mother and father found out about it and made us, made me go down and apologize. I was horrified. But I did it. And they had one of the first TVs in town, you put a quarter and you got to watch Audi duty and programs like that. So I became a constant visitor down there with a handful of quarters that I got stole from my mom. And, uh, watched tidy duty and programs like that. And so that was in their home, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And she would bake us cookies and give us orange juice and Pepsi Colas. Uh, then going down the street, let's see, where are we now? The, the Turners lived on the corner, which is the gun shop now. No, next to the gun shop then, uh, luck house. No.  
Speaker 2    01:38:48    Yeah, the Luck house. There are two lucks. I've forgotten what the first luck name was. And then the second luck was, uh, uh, Preston Luck. He later divorced his wife. They had three daughters stay in touch. One of 'em just died. Stay in touch with the oldest daughter from time to time. Get Christmas. Um, three daughters. Her mother, when she was having the youngest daughter came here and had the baby on the couch in this room. The little girl. I saw the whole thing. I was horrified. <laugh>. How old were you? Young. Yeah. And we had to throw the couch at Burn the couch. Uh, then they took her to the hospital. When my daddy met her, he was already at the hospital. Which hospital then? Was that be Leesburg? The original hospital. I had my tonsils out over there. And I had a private nurse. Dad had hired a private nurse. He had slept in the bed the night before. 'cause he was delivering a baby over there. And there was sand in the bed. I'll never forget that. And I looked out the window and there were horses grazing in the field, which was all well and good. Came home the amber, God had just opened up where the bank is now. And I went up and I got popcorn and I burst the stitches  
Speaker 2    01:40:23    And couldn't stitch it up again. Had ize it, which was a very uncomfortable and smell bad. Same day, the school bus  
Speaker 2    01:40:38    From the Baptist Church where they'd had bible school, had a little boy who had its head out of the window and a semi-truck came by and decaffeinated. And all the kids got to see that his head landed in the road and somebody ran over it. Now isn't that dreadful? Wait, he, he was where, he was in the school bus. Right. From Bible school. Baptist Bible School. And he had his head out the window just watching the traffic, looking around. And a truck came by semi and the mirror decapitated it. And his head rolled in the highway and a car ran over it. Can you imagine? And all kids on school bus. And that was right in the middle of Middleburg, outside of town. Can you imagine? Hmm. I can't,  
Speaker 5    01:41:30    I dunno. This is going dark now. <laugh>. Maybe it's a good breaking point. Film the water. Maybe it's a good  
Speaker 2    01:41:36    <laugh>. Then we came down the street after the luck house, uh, was the Episcopal minister, bill Dunbar. He had a daughter and a son. Sally and Bill, who I went to school with. Sally and I were good friends. Uh, I, one time my mother who was, uh, had gone, been educated, she went to William and Mary graduated at 17, then went on to nursing school, which her parents didn't want her to do. And she became a nurse, though she never practiced, as I said. And when she moved here, uh, and she went to a nursing school, Providence Hospital, which was the Catholic hospital then. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She became Catholic. And I used to, in the, her bedroom was right in the room next door. I used to, um, go through her drawer of her dresser. She had two little side drawers up top of her dresser and all her beads in her car, prayer cards and stuff.  
Speaker 2    01:42:39    And I'd play with her beads and do all that. But there was no Catholic church. There was no Catholic church. So she went to the Baptist church. 'cause all her friends went there. My dad went to the Episcopal church. He was Episcopal, and Bill Dunbar was a minister. While we were in catechism class, myself and my brother. And I stayed one day when all my friends were being baptized, being dumped at the Baptist church. And I got dunked, came home all the way, changed clothes and went to Episcopal Church. When Bill Dunbar found out about it, he raised ca and kicked me outta catechism class, said I couldn't be baptized in the Episcopal church. I'd already been baptized in the Baptist church, so it couldn't be confirmed. So I never got confirmed. My brothers, my brother did. So iri, I die, I will die even, although it  
Speaker 5    01:43:37    Might not be for that sense. <laugh>. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    01:43:43    Although another friend, froggy de became minister next door. He was in service and his, uh, ship had been shot and sank. And he hung onto a board and he said, dear Lord, if you let me survive this, I will become a minister and preach the word. Good word. So he did. So he reinstated me in the Episcopal church. Oh,  
Speaker 1    01:44:15    Now  
Speaker 2    01:44:15    He was a forgiving soul. Your  
Speaker 1    01:44:17    Dad went to this, which, which Episcopal? Right there. Right  
Speaker 2    01:44:19    Here  
Speaker 1    01:44:19    Next door. Because there's another one down across from the Safeway.  
Speaker 2    01:44:24    No, that's not Episcopal church. That's Methodist.  
Speaker 1    01:44:26    It was a Methodist. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Okay.  
Speaker 2    01:44:29    Although the Methodist and the Epi fans did join up from time to time for special occasions. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So anyway, that's that. Um, froggy was a great man. Made the best cheese dip your put in your mouth.  
Speaker 1    01:44:47    Now, when you, you said you were born in dc was that because of, of the hospital? Or  
Speaker 2    01:44:52    Were your parents? Yeah, the doctor, your, my mother and father and, um, staff Hawkin, all pr interned together had Providence Hospital. It's Catholic hospital at the time, it's no longer. And when mother was pregnant, she said, I want Stafford to live my, my baby. And my father said, oh, my dead body. I mean, they were best friends and he'd been best man in their wedding. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So he did, did deliver us. And when my youngest brother Stewart was born, mother's appendix ruptured while she was in labor. And in those days, they kept the incision open and sprinkled it with sulfur. Penicillin wasn't around. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she was in the hospital for three months. And Boo boo, my grandmother, um, took care of, of Stewart. And she barely let us see him. Couldn't hold him. Doc had polio and was isolated and the corner bedroom. And, uh, but he recovered. He got to come home Christmas. And he brought a stack of comic books. We were glad to see him, but we were rapier to see the comic books <laugh>. And he got to stay overnight. And then he had to go back to the hospital.  
Speaker 1    01:46:19    And that was, that was the hospital in dc. In DC  
Speaker 2    01:46:23    He was so always so sickly. Anyway, when I got pregnant, I went to Aver dog and died. My babies delivered. And every time he delivered one I'd get, I'd call and say, I haven't gotten a bill. And he said, your insurance company took it around. I said, well, they didn't come anywhere near your fee. And he said, well, it's a baby present <laugh>. So all three, my babies were baby presents from, instead of very often when I had the last one, I didn't go in, in time to have an epidural. And so afterwards, they, they said, you want an epidural? I said, I don't need it. I said, it's just kicking in now after. And he was so bad. We had an intern in the room with, and he said he picked up the after bird. And he said, does this look anything like a horse's Just shocked that bore into him, <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    01:47:16    And I said a little bit. I said, the horses is bigger. So he, I said, is there anything you want? You don't want your morphine now? I said, no, the epidural's taking care of any pain. I said, but I'm starving. It's Newtown. And he sent the poor intern across the street to the French restaurant and got me, um, rainbow trout and vegetables that were to die for cme brulee for dessert and bread, French bread silverware served on China. Then the poor intern had to take it back and stafford off and pay for it, which was nice of it. He quit smoking long ago. But I was still smoking. And I'd go into his office and the first thing he would do, I never had an appointment. I had three dogs with me. I'd come down from New York when I was pregnant with Kathy, take the dogs in with me, and they would get under the desk, the secretary's desk and never move.  
Speaker 2    01:48:19    And I'd go in and after the appointment, stagger would, um, take out the ashtray out of his drawer and put there, and he said, go ahead and smoke <laugh>. So he spoiled me. He came out here and practiced for my dad one time when my dad went to the hospital, he had something wrong and, uh, had have surgery. He used to ride horses for Steve Clark. My dad did. He showed him at Glenwood. Anyway, uh, uh, I gotta say, oh, Staber came out to take over the practice for him while he was in the hospital. And he, poor one poor soul came in, had cancer, and he had to go to Winchester to have surgery. And he had to have a colostomy bag. So when my dad got back, the man was sitting on the steps with a shotgun across his lap. And his dad said, oh man, so and so, what are you doing? He said, I'm waiting for that GED doctor, friend of yours to come back. I'm gonna shoot it his ass. Because he had to have surgery, of course. Never happened. <laugh>. But there was Now was was your, there's some characters around here. Was  
Speaker 1    01:49:46    Your father from here? Is that why he was  
Speaker 2    01:49:49    Practicing here? Actually, he was from Aldi. He was, yeah. He had, um, five brothers. The first one was shot in a poker game in Leesburg. The second one, uh, married an older woman who was his school teacher. And he committed suicide. Eventually he was bad, bad, bad, bad. He was not faithful to his wife. Uh, then Bunny, the youngest Clint, lived in Aldi, lived in Ridgeview to begin with, and then he didn't want his boys to get in trouble. So he moved, bought a farm in, um, below Haling on the way to Leesburg on Watson Road. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, uh, to raise them there. And one of 'em, um, still, well, Liz, both of 'em still live there. One built an apartment over the barn and he, uh, builds race cars and reconditions race cars that race, you know, around local tracks and stuff and other outside of the state. And the, when as historian, he, um, he was a, went to Wakeville and he, uh, documents cemeteries and roads and maps and things around here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And

Speaker 1    01:51:39    So did your dad practice here? Um, immediate, initially, yes,  
Speaker 2    01:51:44    He did. He had an office downstairs in the basement. And also he practiced at the health center. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And that's it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Anything else? Oh, the house on the corner, the White House. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, the Adams family lived there and they had a son who had, um, polio, was completely paralyzed, couldn't speak, couldn't do anything. And my father would take me down to visit with Billy. And, uh, Ms. Adams would roll me out, roll him out, and, um, on the patio. And we'd visit. I'd talk to him as if he could talk and hear me, but I'm not sure he could. Uh, he died. They both died before he did. And they put him in an assisted living and then he died. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He did not very well there.  
Speaker 1    01:52:44    Why was your brother called Duck?  
Speaker 2    01:52:46    Because he was very much like my father. Um, then next was the Montague house where the grassy lived. And the grassy originally lived here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Before my father bought the place. And the house was riddled with rats and mice. And, uh, we had to nail up the vents in the floor and we had to, uh, cover the radiators and we just had to deep funk the house. Right, right. Um,  
Speaker 1    01:53:25    And how, how old were you when your family moved over here?  
Speaker 2    01:53:29    I think about four, five, somewhere there.  
Speaker 1    01:53:31    So you have good memories of  
Speaker 2    01:53:33    Over there too? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:53:36    And was this then, was this house and behind the yard be behind? Behind?  
Speaker 2    01:53:43    Yes. There was a yard behind. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then there was a barn and we had a cook named Lucille who lived in the apartment on the edge of the barn. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Then we had a Launders who was Lucille's mother named Fleecy, but she lived at St. Louis. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Felicia couldn't read. She'd never been to school. And I'd hand her a cookbook and say, Felicia, will you make me this? And she'd hold the book upside down and she'd say, mm. I think she'd said, we can get all the ingredients. I can do this. I was so mean. We always had iced tea and we made sugar mint water, which you kept in the refrigerator. Uhhuh <affirmative> was so good.  
Speaker 1    01:54:22    So good. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 2    01:54:23    And made homemade ice cream during, during ice cream. Made our own butter. Wasn't much. We didn't do. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:54:31    Was, um, did a lot of people from here go off to the war?  
Speaker 2    01:54:36    Yeah. And my mother was a flower show judge. Really? And she was a wonderful, she did wonderful arrangements and she won lots of prizes. And she became National President of the National Federation of Garden Gloves. And they used to have shows here in the house in these two rooms. And often one junior championship for arrangements. I did. And I used to do dollar scenes, do little arrangements on the mantle, and, uh, little arrange make little miniature Reese and things.  
Speaker 1    01:55:21    What was your mother's maiden name?  
Speaker 2    01:55:24    Gresham.  
Speaker 1    01:55:25    Gresham. With an E? Yeah.  
Speaker 2    01:55:27    Gresham. No, wait a minute. G-R-E-S-H-A-M. Yes.  
Speaker 1    01:55:32    And where did she grow up?  
Speaker 2    01:55:33    She grew up in Northern Neck, Virginia. I thought it was Newport News. Newport News. Right. Okay. Yeah. I, I think I remember her daddy owned, um, two, um, bars and went, she eloped with my father and she was engaged to somebody else that they wanted her to marry. And they didn't speak for a year. And then my grandfather got sick and he was upstairs in the bedroom on that side. And every afternoon I think he had pancreatic cancer. Now that I look back on it, we didn't know. We weren't told what he had, just that he was sick. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, he would put his shirt on and his little bow tie. And he was very tall. My grandmother was very short and he would part his hair in the middle 'cause we thought it was funny. And he'd had his, uh, sheet blanket and then a bed blanket cover on, and all puffed up pills. We'd go in, sit on his bed and he'd entertain us with stories. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We'd stay half hour, hour, four to five minutes somewhere mm-hmm <affirmative>. Like that. And then we'd leave. And, uh, he didn't last very long.  
Speaker 1    01:56:59    Now I imagine that not everyone that came to see her father could afford care.  
Speaker 2    01:57:03    No. We always had an extra child in the house. Uh, first one was Norman Myers, who had cancer. He stayed with us until he died. And then we had another child who came and stayed cancer. My father was taken care of and he died. And then when my brother went off to San Military Academy, oldest brother, he came home with a boy named John Tewkesbury, who same age had, was in the same class as my brother Alfred Boarding school. And he, his parents lived in Argentina, where his father was president of the bank. He had been adopted and they had their own natural child. The mother came one time, she didn't even stay 24 hours to see him and then left. Well, my father educated, paid for boarding school and college for John Bury got a scholarship to college. Um, he, he was with us all through college and service. He went into the Navy. He had a girlfriend that eventually married my father helped him with the wedding. And he, um, just recently died two years ago. So I've had an interesting life.  
Speaker 1    01:58:38    Yes, you have. Did you, uh, go to school away from here? Yes. After the Hill School? Yes.  
Speaker 2    01:58:45    Where did you go? I went to Southern Seminary. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I thought I was being kicked out for smoking. I lived in a tower and, uh, Mamie was her eye smother and she couldn't, she had had, had a broken hip and couldn't go upstairs. And so everybody came up and smoked in the tower with us. We had surrounding windows so we could open the windows and puff away. I thought you went to Holton Arms first. No, that was later. Oh. So, um, Southern <inaudible>, the junior college, we had to stay there Thanksgiving. 'cause we had a Thanksgiving banquet on, on Wednesday nights. So my dad always sent a driver down to pick me up after the banquet. Got home late midnight. And one time when I came home, my roommate had been kicked out. She was from Pennsylvania. And I got back to school. I said, why was Connie kicked out?  
Speaker 2    01:59:41    And they said she was caught smoking in the tower. And I said, well, I smoked up there and I was on Student Body, student Council. And they said, well, we didn't catch you. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So you could stay right on Susan Councils. I said, well, I don't think that's right. They said, well, that's what Cookie Crus. So anyway, she was gone. And I didn't have a roommate for a long while. And people still continue to come up there and smoke. I did too. And when I graduated, I went down to Mamie's Room, which was below the US and I said, Mamie, I just want to apologize for all the bad things I did for smoking. And I said, furthermore, I said, we covered your toilet seat between the, the ring and the porcelain with Saran wrap. And we put manure there and we put 'em in the, the, uh, toes of your slippers and in your road pocket. I said, I, I really, I'm ashamed of have to confess that. And she said, I knew you, you were part of it. She said, but it was that bread for Connie's influence. So I forgave you. And I said, and furthermore I said, we had a hot plate, electric hot plate down underneath the call foot tub at the end of the hall where we used to cook. And she said, I knew that. She said, I finally took that away. She said, but that was your horrible roommate's influence. <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    02:01:23    And was it Connie that thought up all those things? No,  
Speaker 2    02:01:29    Our room was the most popular room. And that was my first encounter with gays. We had two girls at the end of the hall were gay. I never knew what gay was. Never even heard the word. So I learned a lot at school <laugh>, none of which was in books <laugh>. I, um, went to Hill School. As I said, there were only three rooms. I had remedial reading with Ms. Beige every afternoon my four family had to pay for, 'cause they couldn't read, never did Learn to Read. Went off to Bar Harbor, Maine to a special school up there. And they tested me and said, yeah, you can't read, can't spell. So they flashed words on screen, big print, and then small print. So they taught me to sight read. And they said, you will never be able to spell, but people will always know what you're trying to say. Well, I became such a reader after that about every book I could get my hands on. When I was up there, I went to school with Tony Downey Jr. Who was son of the Performer, and Al Joseph Jolson's son. Uh, it was a wonderful summer. Went to concerts at the hotel there. I loved it. I had a great time up there and learned to read.  
Speaker 1    02:02:59    So how, how old were you at that point?  
Speaker 2    02:03:02    14.  
Speaker 1    02:03:02    14. So, and then the Hill School still was at, went to eighth grade at that point? Yes. So then you went Yeah. And then you went to Hilton  
Speaker 2    02:03:11    Nors, then I went to Norms. Yeah. And when I got to Hol Norms, the uh, English teacher there said, in all my years teaching, I have never had a student that couldn't spell. And she said, and this year I have two, so I will grade their papers differently. So I got lucky.  
Speaker 1    02:03:32    Now, did you n not learn, dispel just 'cause you never knew or?  
Speaker 2    02:03:36    I was told deaf. So all that money wasted all those years with Ms. May and learned. I had French, can't speak a word of French to this day. It had French from the second grade on.  
Speaker 1    02:03:56    Maybe that's why they don't teach languages at the Hill School anymore. <laugh>. It's too, too early, too  
Speaker 2    02:04:02    Easy. I early in high school had Latin. I do not speak Latin, but I enjoyed it. And I do understand words now. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know where they come from. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So that was good. Right. And I devoured lot in books, even though as I say, I can't speak it.  
Speaker 1    02:04:23    Yeah.
