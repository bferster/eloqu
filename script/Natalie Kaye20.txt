Interviewer    00:00:00    And when did you come to Middleburg?  
Kaye    00:00:02    When I was eight years old. Mm-Hmm.  
Interviewer    00:00:04    <affirmative>. And why did you come, why were you brought here?  
Kaye    00:00:07    Because my mother and father were getting a divorce and my mother had been down here to Fox Hunt, um, for several years before that and thought it was a wonderful place. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and decided to move here with me. And of course I had never been, I'd hardly ever met my mother before because <laugh>, I had a nurse that I adored. And when I was separated from my nurse, it was a disaster, but it worked out.  
Interviewer    00:00:39    Do you have any siblings that came? No. No. So just the two of you came Uhhuh <affirmative>. That must have been a good adventure.  
Kaye    00:00:46    <laugh>. It really was. <laugh>. It was a scary adventure at first, but it turned out beautifully. Mm-Hmm.  
Interviewer    00:00:52    <affirmative>. And where did you move to in the area when you came? When  
Kaye    00:00:55    We first came, we were paying guests at Missy Saban.  
Interviewer    00:00:59    And I don't know where that is, would you,  
Kaye    00:01:00    That's where, um, that's where Melissa Phipps and Birdie's Place is now.  
Interviewer    00:01:08    What road is that? On  
Kaye    00:01:10    Six 11.  
Interviewer    00:01:14    And you stayed there for a while?  
Kaye    00:01:16    We stayed there for I think a year or two, and then we moved into the house on Route 50 where Rufuss Humphrey lived. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, uh, of course we, all we wanted to do was play with horses. And so there it was.  
Interviewer    00:01:40    And you went to school here?  
Kaye    00:01:42    I went to the Hill School. You did? And, uh, I, when I went, when I first went there, there were 30 children in the school. And then it dropped down to my last year before I went to boarding school, there were 15 children in the school. Wow. And I was in a class of one.  3333
Interviewer    00:02:01    You were the only child in your grade? Yes,  
Kaye    00:02:04    <laugh>. But when I got to boarding school, I was up with all my classmates. So  
Interviewer    00:02:10    Where did you go to off to boarding school?  
Kaye    00:02:12    Miss Hall's. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in Pittsfield, mass. Right. And, uh, that was good. Made lifelong friends there. Right. And, uh, then came back here, of course, for vacations. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then eventually my mother remarried and we lived at Stone Hedge, which is a farm near here. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, uh, well, we, we all had fun.  
Interviewer    00:02:51    Uh, who did your mother remarry?  
Kaye    00:02:54    Bill Halbert. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I had five step brothers and sisters. Suddenly.  
Interviewer    00:03:04    And you were already in high school by that point?  
Kaye    00:03:07    No. Well, wait a minute. Let me think. Um, I guess, I guess I was when they, I can't remember whether I was or not when they first married. I think I was though.  
Interviewer    00:03:26    So you were away at boarding school? Yeah. But you would come back in holidays and summers. And did you spend a lot of time in New York City?  
Kaye    00:03:34    Um, when I was very little I did, but not after that.  
Interviewer    00:03:38    You didn't go back  
Kaye    00:03:39    To Oh yeah. We went back every year. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, 'cause I had a lot of relations there. Right.  
Interviewer    00:03:45    Did you spend time with your dad there?  
Kaye    00:03:48    No, I wasn't allowed to do that. My father was an alcoholic and that was a problem.  
Interviewer    00:03:56    So your mother had brought you down here and  
Kaye    00:03:58    Yeah. And, uh, and it turned out beautifully down here when that those first years, Missy Saban was very much of a child. She didn't have any children of her own, but she was wonderful with children. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> later on, she looked after the Phipps children, but, um, she, we had a, that first winter we had lots of snow and Missy said, you know what's really funny is coasting on trays, and we'll take 10 trays out there and coast. Well, that was so nice of her. And it was so fun. Right. And, and, uh, you know, I had a pony right away and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and a and a dog. And so it was nice.  
Interviewer    00:04:52    And did you fox hunt when you were young?  
Kaye    00:04:56    Yes. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.  
Interviewer    00:04:58    Who did you hunt with?  
Kaye    00:05:00    We hunted at those first years with Piedmont. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then later on, um, with both Orange Caddy, all three hunts. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> really.  
Interviewer    00:05:13    What was it like being in Middleburg when you were a child? What did you do?  
Kaye    00:05:18    Well, every day when you got home from school, you got on your pony, Uhhuh <affirmative>, and rode and, uh, played on the farm. And, you know, we, we had, we visited each other. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> Well, I mean our, my classmates, because in those early years I had classmates. Right. Um, and we take, you know, we'd take turns going to each other's houses and, but it usually involved riding. You  
Interviewer    00:05:52    Would ride to your friend's house.  
Kaye    00:05:54    So, yeah. Well, later on, after we moved to, to the hou the, the next house, um, the McConnell's lived on the Zula Road, and Betty McConnell was my best friend. And every afternoon when we got home from school, we'd meet after lunch, we'd have lunch at home, and then we'd get on our ponies and we'd meet and we'd ride all afternoon.  
Interviewer    00:06:18    That sounds like a wonderful way to grow up.  
Kaye    00:06:20    It was fun. It really was.  
Interviewer    00:06:23    And there were, um, the people whose property went through, talk about how, uh, people would, I guess, just let you ride on any property you wanted to.  
Kaye    00:06:39    Oh, yes. Everybody knew each other. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I mean, in those days it was such a tiny community. And they, and the, all the people from the north that had, that had moved here, had moved here for the hunting. And, uh, so it, you, you know, you, you went wherever you wanted to go and nobody expected you not to. So that was, that was all right. I mean, nobody, it, it never crossed anybody's mind, I don't think, to ask if they could go through. 'cause it was taken for granted that she would. Right. And there were so few people. And the, the Route 50 was when we first came, route 50 was a dirt road. Was it from Middleburg? Not, not from Washington to Middleburg, but from Middleburg West. And then of course, very soon it got paved. Right. And the people that worked on the road were mostly, um, chain gangs. And they used to have, they used to have the prisons all dressed up in stripes and, uh, and a gun at either end with a policeman, different world.  
Interviewer    00:08:03    Right. Just getting that done. Yeah. Did you go into town a lot?  
Kaye    00:08:09    Not much,  
Interviewer    00:08:10    No.  
Kaye    00:08:11    No.  
Interviewer    00:08:12    What, what did you do in the town of Middleburg when you were younger?  
Kaye    00:08:18    You just did your shopping? I mean, the, there were just, there was a hardware store and a feed store and a drug store. And there were two drug stores, as a matter of fact. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, um, a couple of grocery stores. And that was it. None of these boutiquey kind of places.  
Interviewer    00:08:44    Did you go to Washington at all?  
Kaye    00:08:46    No. Sometimes, but not often. Right.  
Interviewer    00:08:49    Your life was pretty much centered out here around  
Kaye    00:08:52    Yeah, pretty much out here. We'd go in town and, and the, and the thing was that you always met your family in front of the elevators, in the Mayflower Hotel.  
Interviewer    00:09:02    Really? <laugh>.  
Kaye    00:09:03    That was the meeting, that was the meeting place. The Mayflower was the only decent hotel in Washington then. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.  
Interviewer    00:09:10    When you say your family, you mean you would've gone,  
Kaye    00:09:14    Well if you were, you turned loose, um, when you were a little, I was a little bit older then. Right then. And you were meeting your mother or stepfather or brothers or stepsisters, you'd always meet in front of the elevators, the Mayflower.  
Interviewer    00:09:35    And then did you go to university?  
Kaye    00:09:38    I went to Sarah Lawrence.  
Interviewer    00:09:44    And what did you study?  
Kaye    00:09:47    Theater.  
Interviewer    00:09:48    Oh, that's fun.  
Kaye    00:09:50    But I didn't, I didn't graduate. I, I didn't, I got married and I worked, actually it was during the war, so I worked down, um, as a nurse, as a Red Cross Nurse's aide first when I was, I guess 16, 17 in the, um, Winchester Hospital. And then I went to what is now the Greenbriar in Whiteford Springs, but was then Ashford General Army Hospital.  
Interviewer    00:10:23    Really? I didn't realize that.  
Kaye    00:10:24    Yeah. And, and, uh, there were about a dozen of us. We were volunteers and they worked us hard and they, they housed us and they fed us. And, um, we worked the same hours as the nurses. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> eight hour days, eight hour shifts. And, and so I was there for a year, maybe a little over a year.  
Interviewer    00:10:53    And what were your responsibilities there?  
Kaye    00:10:56    Well, you were looking after patients and doing We did, we gave, we, we were taught to give penicillin shots, and then we gave back rubs and change bed pans and, and did, you know, go for work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But they, they needed us because they were, they, you know, they nurses didn't have time to do everything. Right.  
Interviewer    00:11:23    They were doing the acute care and you were  
Kaye    00:11:26    Yeah. You were doing  
Interviewer    00:11:27    It. Were keeping people comfortable.  
Kaye    00:11:28    Yeah.  
Interviewer    00:11:30    Who, who was, who were the patients?  
Kaye    00:11:33    They were army wounded, army, um, men.  
Interviewer    00:11:40    And how do you know how they were allocated to come to that exact hospital?  
Kaye    00:11:45    I don't,  
Interviewer    00:11:46    But people that were From the area or from all area? Oh,  
Kaye    00:11:49    Oh, no. From everywhere. It was, it, it was interesting. And it was, um,  
Speaker 3    00:11:56    It was a neat experience actually. Hello. No, those  
Kaye    00:12:06    Horrible things.  
Interviewer    00:12:06    Right.  
Kaye    00:12:12    So,  
Interviewer    00:12:12    Go ahead.  
Kaye    00:12:14    That was the, the, there was a German, um, prisoner camp Right. Very close by. And they did, took care of the grounds and, and did some of the cooking. And they were mostly from the Africa Corps prisoners. And then the patients were all, for the most part, American soldiers. There were a few that were other, were other nationalities. And I don't know how come they were there, but they were, but they were fabulous boys. There were, there was one ward that had guys that had their spinal cords severed and they couldn't move. And you'd walk into that ward and honestly, they were absolutely amazing. They'd be laughing and joking with each other. And here are these young guys that were in such terrible shape, but they were just so brave. Mm-Hmm.  
Interviewer    00:13:26    <affirmative>, the people that they brought in, the German prisoners that, that they brought in. Do you, did you witness any of the interaction between them and the, uh, men that were there?  
Kaye    00:13:43    No, there wasn't any really. There wasn't any, no. They were, no, they were, they were, they worked, but they, nobody talked to them.  
Interviewer    00:13:57    And was that enforced or was that just kind of,  
Kaye    00:14:01    I think, I think if you had, it would've been enforced, but nobody did so. Right. It was just the way it was.  
Interviewer    00:14:10    And why, why was that? Did you get the sense of the emotion behind that?  
Kaye    00:14:16    Well, it was just that they were, had been the enemy. They were perfectly nice looking boys. Right. But you just, um, didn't fraternize <laugh>.  
Interviewer    00:14:34    And what do you, what year was that, that you were there?  
Speaker 3    00:14:38    I,  
Kaye    00:14:39    I guess that was, uh, in the 43 maybe. Mm-Hmm.  
Interviewer    00:14:45    <affirmative>  
Kaye    00:14:46    42 3 because I was married in 45. Mm-Hmm.  
Interviewer    00:14:53    <affirmative>. Then you went back to school after you were at the No. Then you didn't  
Kaye    00:15:03    No. Didn't  
Interviewer    00:15:04    Came back here,  
Kaye    00:15:05    Got married and then Yes. And well, we were living first in New York and then in outside Philadelphia. And then my husband got sick. He got tb and he had to be, um, separated from everybody in those days. They put people to bed for a year. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so we came back down here and he went to, into a place in Charlottesville, a TB place. And he was there for a year. Hmm.  
Interviewer    00:15:42    Uh, and what was your husband's name?  
Kaye    00:15:44    Howard. Kay.  
Interviewer    00:15:47    And where did you meet him?  
Kaye    00:15:49    Here. His family lived here. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. His mother lived here.  
Interviewer    00:15:53    And how had you met him?  
Kaye    00:15:56    I think at one of the many dances that you, we used to have in the, the dances in the old days were in the elementary school house  
Interviewer    00:16:07    Over here  
Kaye    00:16:08    On the way to,  
Interviewer    00:16:08    On the way Yeah. Into town. Yeah.  
Kaye    00:16:12    And the, you know, all the hunt bulls and everything were in there. And the New Year's Eve parties, it was before the community center was built. Right. And so I guess I, I must have met him at one of those.  
Interviewer    00:16:30    And had he been born here?  
Kaye    00:16:33    No, he was born in Boston. And he went to, he went to boarding school when he was seven and was in boarding school until he went to college. And then he went to Yale and graduated from that. And then he went in the Navy and then, uh, eventually came back here. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.  
Kaye    00:16:57    And I was his stepfather, trained racehorses. And so I went to a dinner party one night when I was, I guess I was 17 or 18 or something. And I happened to, it was such a small community then you all ages would be at the same parties? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I sat next to his stepfather and he said, um, he said, all my half my exercise boys have gone into the Army and I need somebody to Gallup horses. Why don't you come and Gallup for me? And so I said, oh, I'd like to do that. And so I did. And Howard would be upstairs sleeping, 'cause we'd get there at 5:00 AM <laugh> and get, you know, two or three sets out. And then I go in for breakfast and he eventually started coming down for breakfast, which was unusual. And I guess that's how that we started.  
Interviewer    00:18:04    And his, um, what was his stepfather's name?  
Kaye    00:18:09    Jack Skinner.  
Interviewer    00:18:10    Jack Skinner. That's a name I've heard.  
Kaye    00:18:12    Yeah.  
Interviewer    00:18:17    Did you do, um, anything with racing beyond Galloping? The horses?  
Kaye    00:18:22    No. No. I never rode, rode races. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but no, but on, Gallop in, and that was really fun.  
Interviewer    00:18:32    Yeah.  
Kaye    00:18:34    Like that.  
Interviewer    00:18:36    Um, how many horses did they have there?  
Kaye    00:18:41    I guess about 20.  
Interviewer    00:18:44    And what did your husband do when he came back from, uh, from college or from the Navy? I guess  
Kaye    00:18:51    From the war, really. He, well, he was still in the Navy when we were married. And then, um, he ended up running the training track here.  
Interviewer    00:19:03    Oh, really?  
Kaye    00:19:06    For below the Paul Mellon then.  
Interviewer    00:19:13    So he was in with the racing too?  
Kaye    00:19:15    Yeah. Or just  
Interviewer    00:19:16    The man  
Kaye    00:19:17    Management. But he, he never got on, I mean, once in a while he'd, if I was sick or something, he'd, um, exercise my hunter if needed to be, and he'd always get run away with. So <laugh>, he didn't really like that very much.  
Interviewer    00:19:35    Tell me about the, um, you've referenced all the dances and hunt balls, and can you talk a little bit about the Society of Middleburg when you were, um,  
Kaye    00:19:47    Coming up? Well, it was, um, as I said, very small community and the, the all ages would be at, I mean, from the age from when you were old enough to go, um, to those dances, all ages would be there. And, uh, sometimes, apparently, usually I had gone home by the time this happened, but usually, um, there would be a fight at the end <laugh>. And, uh, that usually consisted of the Randolph family. Oh yeah. Dr. Randolph and his son, his two sons would get into altercations with people and, uh, but they were, you know, they were otherwise fun. Lots of pink coats and, and everybody dressed to the teeth and, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> all having a good time.  
Interviewer    00:20:51    Would there be a.
