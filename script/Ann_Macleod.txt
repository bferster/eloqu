Speaker 0    00:00:00    Okay
Speaker 1    00:00:02    Now, would you please state your name and your date of birth?  
Speaker 2    00:00:07    I pick it up from over there. End?  
Speaker 1    00:00:09    Yes. Yeah,  
Speaker 2    00:00:13    Now. Okay. I'm Ann Kivlighan Mcleod and I born and raised in <Staunton @38.15845,-79.06019,12>, Virginia, in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley. So I'm a valley girl, and I was born on the 28th of June, 1922, which makes me 98. And in June I'll be 99. Wow.  
Speaker 1    00:00:39    And when did you come to, when and how did you come to Middleburg?  
Speaker 2    00:00:44    Uh,  
Speaker 2    00:00:46    I, at the end of World War II I ended up overseas at <Red Cross Club Mobile https://www.middleburglife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ann-MacLeod-Red-Cross-3-courtesy.jpg>. And then I stayed and worked in Austria for a couple of years. And I was, I'm a writer and I came back and I was working in Washington and I had gone to college with the girl that lived in Upperville. And of course I had become a major skier living in Austria. If you, if you don't ski, you're very lonely. And, uh, so she said, oh, I know a guy that ski, he went to, to, um, uh, <Dartmouth https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltde8121fc52c5c8f3/blt159bdc0549407f0a/66e321e67daa46b2ee0b6c70/2ABN95Y.jpg?width=1280&auto=webp&quality=95&format=jpg&disable=upscale>. So she had us for dinner and we got married three months later. <laugh>, that was Sadie, mcl. And we lived next door. You could still see that place over there. And I finally, it just became too much for me to ruin. I was running it as a horse farm and I sold 150 acres and kept 13 here and found a plants for my house and just rebuilt my house with a few modification. Like, it's very, not very convenient. 'cause in emergency I can walk to Upperville.  
Speaker 1    00:01:58    Right, right. Now when you, um, moved here, you were still working in Washington? Pardon? Were you still working in Washington  
Speaker 2    00:02:07    When moved here? No. Oh, no. I, when I got married, I quit my job and came out here.  
Speaker 1    00:02:13    Right. And your husband, his name was,  
Speaker 2    00:02:15    Uh, <Sandy McLeod https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fauquier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/34/a343411a-98c7-11e8-a05a-13488b6a7717/5b671d947f6a6.image.jpg> was a horse trainer and he bred and trained horses. And you can look over there, that's all part of our farm. It was 153 acres. And so after Sandy died and I, it was just too much to keep up. So I sold, um, a hundred, I sold all the 13 acres and I kept the Upperville side and found the plans for my house and rebuilt this house with a fee modification.  
Speaker 1    00:02:49    What was the farm called at the time?  
Speaker 2    00:02:51    Also <Dunvegan https://edc747615c65f9e8f903-73213d88ef3ab457027e1fa78349bf90.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/39/70/3970f6a692d3051a27124dd1735915244157aed2_big.jpg?timestamp=6768a0d2c6e1f>, uh, that's a lot of McLeod's name things. Dunvegan, it's after McLeod  on the isle of Skye.  
Speaker 1    00:03:03    Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:03:05    And like, this is called the driveway here is Dunvegan Lane or Drive or something. Right, right. And uh, when we had a boat, we named it Yeah. Dunvegan and, you know, so everybody, this is sort of a McLeod thing.  
Speaker 1    00:03:18    Right. Um, how did your husband come to Upperville? Pardon? How did your husband come to Upperville?  
Speaker 2    00:03:24    Uh, they, uh, he went to <Dartmouth https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltde8121fc52c5c8f3/blt159bdc0549407f0a/66e321e67daa46b2ee0b6c70/2ABN95Y.jpg?width=1280&auto=webp&quality=95&format=jpg&disable=upscale> and right before World War II started, his family bought land. They had a farm here, and got into the horse business. And so he had been living here through the World War II and then from then on  
Speaker 1    00:03:48    Right.  
Speaker 2    00:03:48    They were originally from Boston.  
Speaker 1    00:03:50    They were, how did they find <Upperville @38.99476,-77.88450,15>?  
Speaker 2    00:03:54    How did they find God knows I didn't know 'em then <laugh>. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:03:58    I guess the horse business.  
Speaker 2    00:04:00    Well, yeah. I mean, I think you, when you go to real estate agents like that, you live up north and they take you all around and show you many, many places. And they like what they saw in Middleburg and they owned Hunts  
Speaker 1    00:04:16    Before  
Speaker 2    00:04:18    Hunts is over here.  
Speaker 1    00:04:19    Right. I know where Hunts is behind, behind Millbrook.  
Speaker 2    00:04:22    Right,  
Speaker 1    00:04:23    Right. And so this, this, uh, Dunvegan farm belonged to you and your husband was not a family farm of his.  
Speaker 2    00:04:32    Right. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:04:34    Tell me about your horse business.  
Speaker 2    00:04:37    Uh, well that's all gone now. I'm not in the horse. I haven't been in the horse business since shortly after my husband died. I, it's very expensive business to be in. You have to have a lot of, you have to win a lot of races. And I figured this is not going to work out 'cause I'd have to hire a trainer and everything. So I gradually sold off all the horses. Right. And then I, the, on the old property, there's a racetrack and everything and, and I ran that like a training center for a while, but I thought this is ridiculous. So I finally sold that off, found the plans, rebuilt this house here, and moved over here.  
Speaker 1    00:05:21    Um, whe when your husband and you had the course business, it was race horses.  
Speaker 2    00:05:28    He, he was, he was a trainer and we used to take our horses to, uh, we could ship off the farm and run at Feco at Laurel, but then we'd go up in the summer to, to New York racing and we'd run at Belmont in Aqueduct and then we'd go to Saratoga for the <Saratoga @43.07434,-73.78032,13> season.  
Speaker 1    00:05:50    And how many horses would you take  
Speaker 2    00:05:51    At a time? Oh, we usually had a, we usually had 20. We were lucky we could get a Barnes 20 uhhuh. And you know, some are, some are just coming up and some are ready to run and so forth. But we, it's a great advantage to have a place back here where you can ship a horse that needs to be turned out and rested and everything like that. So we moved our horses a lot.  
Speaker 1    00:06:19    Right, right. Now these were belonging to other owners?  
Speaker 2    00:06:24    Yes. He, he did have other, mostly friends of his, but he had other owners too. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:06:30    So what percentage of them were your horses versus other people's  
Speaker 2    00:06:35    Horses? Oh, it's hard to say. It's a long time ago. We always had two or three horses  
Speaker 1    00:06:42    Of your own.  
Speaker 2    00:06:43    So you were  
Speaker 1    00:06:44    That he was  
Speaker 2    00:06:46    This portrait here right behind you? This probably our best horse. His name was Ser. Okay,  
Speaker 1    00:06:55    Spell that.  
Speaker 2    00:06:56    B-E-S-O-M-E-R, which is a Gaelic word. Uhhuh. And he is a descendant from, um, oh God, trying to think of how he got that name. That is a, that is a portrait by Gene Bowman. And that's the racetrack at Saratoga. And Deemers being saddled. And Sandy is standing there beside the man with the warmup cloth and then watching him saddle over there. The people in the distance there, just by chance the artist was Cz G in Winston Frost <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:07:32    Is that right?  
Speaker 2    00:07:35    But that's the for and it's Saratoga. In the old days you had a tree, you, and that was his tree that he saddled under no matter what the number was, whatever number the horse, they put his number on it. Sandy's tree when he saddled. Very interesting.  
Speaker 1    00:07:53    That is very interesting. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Where would you stay when you went to Saratoga?  
Speaker 2    00:07:57    We, um, first couple of years we rented houses. Then Sandy had this, well I did, he wanted to live on a boat. So we finally found this wonderful little host boat that we, and we found a wonderful place to keep it in, in at Point Lu on the south shore of New York where, so you could, when it had the horses in Belmont that, and then we were ing up the Hudson to Skyville, which is 10 miles from Saratoga. And we docked at Skyville while we were, and we lived on that boat was are wonderful.  
Speaker 1    00:08:34    That's amazing.  
Speaker 2    00:08:35    I know  
Speaker 1    00:08:36    You must have had some fun  
Speaker 2    00:08:38    Oh, great, great times.  
Speaker 1    00:08:41    Now I bet there's a big social season at around those races Yeah. Of a lot of parties and  
Speaker 2    00:08:49    Well, yeah, it's a whole community itself. The horse people, they all went Mont Auc and then they all moved to Saratoga, then they go back and a lot of 'em go south of race in the winter town. We never went down race. We turned our horses out here and gave them a rest, which most people should do.  
Speaker 1    00:09:15    And you still do you still go up to Saratoga?  
Speaker 2    00:09:18    Pardon?  
Speaker 1    00:09:18    Do you still go up to Saratoga?  
Speaker 2    00:09:20    Yes. I went up this last summer and had a wonderful time.  
Speaker 0    00:09:26    This is just new to me to be,  
Speaker 2    00:09:27    Because we have a box and that's, and the box is right on the finish line. And the mcleods have had that box since 1932. Wow. And so, uh, I, I, you know, ask people to sit in it and everything like that. And it's just every Virginian, when they come to Saratoga, it comes to that box. <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:09:52    So the box was Hi, your husband's family.  
Speaker 2    00:09:56    Yeah. Box the, the McLeod's had had that box since 1932  
Speaker 1    00:10:01    When they were here.  
Speaker 2    00:10:02    Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, yeah, now they, they, they lived in Hunts originally. They owned hunt land. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then by the time I married Sandy, he had bought this land over here and built all that, all those barns and the houses and everything on that and sold hunts. Because it looked like at that time, Sandy was a Navy pilot. It looked like World War II was gonna keep on going in the west. And so they, uh, sold hunts and then the roar was over and Sandy was home. So they bought this land and developed another horse operations mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:10:47    So they were very successful to have for so many years. Right.  
Speaker 2    00:10:50    So  
Speaker 0    00:10:51    That one I just did. I put those on.  
Speaker 1    00:10:53    Now when you would go, uh, when you were here,  
Speaker 0    00:10:57    So we might  
Speaker 1    00:10:58    Have to do, what was your schedule like on the farm? Pardon? What was your schedule like on the farm when you were here? What was it like here in Upperville when you had the horse operation? I imagine it's changed a lot. Well,  
Speaker 2    00:11:13    It just like life on anybody who lives on the farm. You just, and say we had a racetrack and he train his horses in the morning and we were lucky we could run a mar and Pinco right off the farm to ship the horses over, run 'em, bring them home. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But then when we'd go to New York to race, we moved up there and we lived all boat and uh, that was really great. And then we took the boat up Hudson, which is a marvelous trip. And, uh, Dr. Skyville, that was 10 miles away from Saratoga area Central.  
Speaker 1    00:11:53    Right. And how long was that New York season out of your year?  
Speaker 2    00:11:57    Pardon?  
Speaker 1    00:11:57    How long was the New York part?  
Speaker 2    00:12:00    How long was,  
Speaker 1    00:12:01    Would you be up in New York?  
Speaker 2    00:12:03    Well, uh, New York racing, uh, at that point they closed in the winter and ton Florida. But now New York racing is all year long. And we usually shift up probably the end of April, 1st of May. It depends, a lot depends on the condition book and whether you have horses or eligible to run the races and everything. Having 20 horses, we would go up and get stalls and settle in and then move up the Hudson too. Of Saratoga. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:12:41    And that's in August.  
Speaker 2    00:12:43    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:12:44    So you'd be gone most of the summer.  
Speaker 2    00:12:46    Well actually Saratoga started this year, the end of July. Or they've stretched it because they do, they do so much better up there than they do at Aqueduct in Belmont in the summer. 'cause all our people on vacation take a day off and go racing and things like that. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:13:06    So the race is more profitable. The race track is is more popular there?  
Speaker 2    00:13:11    Probably, yeah. But the tracks now owned by the, the state you see.  
Speaker 1    00:13:18    Right. And that wasn't the case before they were  
Speaker 2    00:13:22    Well no, it was owned, privately owned.  
Speaker 1    00:13:24    Right, right. Has that made a difference in the quality of the race?  
Speaker 2    00:13:31    The New York is one of the top places to race in the country. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:13:37    Uh, what did it take to keep that operation running? Did you have a pardon? Did you have a large, uh, group of people working for you?  
Speaker 2    00:13:45    Oh yeah. You had, you have to have grooms and exercise boys and hot walkers and everything. We, we, it is a big, it's like the first year I was married, we raced in Chicago talking. It was like moving a circus. It was incredibly interesting. And we moved them all like that.  
Speaker 1    00:14:08    Chase  
Speaker 2    00:14:10    Got 'em all back. <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:14:14    And how did you do in Chicago?  
Speaker 2    00:14:16    Pardon?  
Speaker 1    00:14:17    How did you do in Chicago?  
Speaker 2    00:14:19    I, I'm terribly sorry. You're gonna have to speak louder. I can't hear you.  
Speaker 1    00:14:24    How were, how was the racing in Chicago?  
Speaker 2    00:14:27    Oh, it was tough. It's good racing. It always has been. And Sandy was dying to try it. And he, we, we, we won a number of races out there among the people that were racing there that year. A friend of ours was, say Alan Jerkin, one of the leading trainers at the Hall of Fame. And all of us, you know, got to, would get together. And then we all end up at Sarah Target <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:14:55    So you see the same people.  
Speaker 2    00:14:58    Yeah. Right. From  
Speaker 1    00:14:59    Track to track, right? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And do you get rivalries? Pardon? Are there big rivalries between the different trainers?  
Speaker 2    00:15:06    Well, not really. Uh, it's, you know, the emphasis is on the horse and if you have good horses and know how to place 'em in the races, you do very well. But, you know, people wanna win. So  
Speaker 1    00:15:22    Many of those things memorized. One  
Speaker 2    00:15:24    Of our friends, uh, we were friendly with the Chenery secretary owners. Penny Chenery and I were both in the American Red Cross during World War ii. So we had a lot in common. And, uh, we saw a lot of the chenery.  
Speaker 1    00:15:43    Where did they live?  
Speaker 2    00:15:45    They lived at, they lived in, they, they're from Doswell down here. And then, uh, they, they had a major stable with a private trainer and all of that. And uh, they rented, I think they bought a house in Saratoga or North Broadway. I think they owned the house they lived in, what is the due? I can't remember whether they just rented it or owned it.  
Speaker 1    00:16:07    January 5th,  
Speaker 2    00:16:09    Two. Oh. And then we lived on the boat, of course the Motor Inn and all that.  
Speaker 1    00:16:15    When you were in World War ii, where were you? Nine.  
Speaker 2    00:16:22    I went overseas. I was a Red Cross Club mobile girl, and we had these cute little three quarter ton trucks in the back. We had racks of donuts and coffees and we would drive from one encampment to another. And I was, uh, in European theater. And, uh, it was really very, very interesting. I really covered a lot of ground <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:16:49    Were you writing when you were there? Pardon? Were you writing?  
Speaker 2    00:16:54    Oh yeah. Well, in fact, I found some stuff this morning. I was cleaning out something and I came across all sorts of stuff. I started reading that I had written years and years and years ago.  
Speaker 1    00:17:09    When you were in Europe?  
Speaker 2    00:17:11    Well, yeah. And then even here, I, it'd been published quite a bit.  
Speaker 1    00:17:18    Did you write about the racing?  
Speaker 2    00:17:21    Uh, occasionally. And I interviewed a lot of people for racing, uh, magazines like Penny Chenery and, and all those, all towels. Anyway, so I could do that.  
Speaker 1    00:17:34    And where would those stories be placed?  
Speaker 2    00:17:38    They, uh, most of them were in Spur Magazine, dead Now. It was a very active horse racing magazine called Spur at one point. It was published in Middleburg. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:17:52    Was it, uh, part of the Chronicle of the Horse?  
Speaker 2    00:17:56    Pardon?  
Speaker 1    00:17:57    Was it had anything to do with the Chronicle of the Horse?  
Speaker 2    00:18:03    The quality of the,  
Speaker 1    00:18:04    The Chronicle of the Horse? The  
Speaker 2    00:18:06    Magazine. Oh, the Chronic, no, no, no. That's another outfit. Completely. That's Chronicle used to be more of show horses instead of race horses.  
Speaker 1    00:18:20    And Spur was  
Speaker 2    00:18:21    More race horses  
Speaker 1    00:18:22    About race horses,  
Speaker 2    00:18:23    Right? Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:18:24    I'd like to see that. I wonder if they have that at the  
Speaker 2    00:18:28    Oh, I'm sure they boarding library. Oh, I'm sure they have all the old copies there.  
Speaker 1    00:18:34    Maybe I can find your articles. <laugh>,  
Speaker 2    00:18:36    They're around <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:18:39    Did you work as a writer before you worked the  
Speaker 2    00:18:41    Work? Well, I read Should I lived, I, you know, would write home and everything I've always written. And, uh, it, and I actually, that's my job was writing, taking consolidating reports for busy generals and things like that. It, if, you know, it's just one of those things that if you can do it, it's a good talent to have.  
Speaker 1    00:19:07    Right. Were when you went with the Red Cross?  
Speaker 2    00:19:12    No, I wasn't writing then. Right. Yeah. I was just writing letters home letters  
Speaker 1    00:19:16    Home. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. When were you writing with the generals?  
Speaker 2    00:19:21    Oh, that was when I, I guess I got, when I, after I got out of the Red Cross, I worked on Germany for the American government. See we stayed over there, the government. And it was, and I was in Austria and it was divided in the, the Russians, the, uh, French, the British and the Americans. Right. All the section  
Speaker 1    00:19:49    Had  
Speaker 2    00:19:50    Divided. Right. Yeah. And it was really great 'cause I lived in Salzburg and all the music and everything. And then you could go up to Vienna for the opera. Oh, terrific.  
Speaker 1    00:20:01    It's a wonder you came back.  
Speaker 2    00:20:03    It's interesting. I got up one morning and I learned to ski and I love to ski and I looked in the mirror and I said, if you don't go home, you're gonna be an ex patriot. And I was on the next boat home <laugh>. 'cause I knew I could pick up a job in Washington very easily. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. With my background and my job.  
Speaker 1    00:20:23    Right. When you came back, did you work in Washington  
Speaker 2    00:20:28    Then? Yeah, I had an apartment on Prospect Street up near the university. Yeah, I know exactly. And that's when I, Courtney Hansen, my friend that I'd gone to Mary Ballroom, we'd lived in Upperville and that's where she was living near me. And she had me for dinner. And I Sandy, because she knew that I skied. Right. And he, and he, see, we figured he went to Dartmouth. He had to ski too. And so that's how I got met my husband.  
Speaker 1    00:20:56    And, and then you stopped working. Yeah. Well, you stopped working in Washington. Yeah. Moved here. Yeah. And worked on the farm with him.  
Speaker 2    00:21:03    Well, not really working. He ran the farm. And then I would, um, occasionally write an article for Spur some magazine.  
Speaker 1    00:21:15    Right. Would you ride horses? Did you have any interest in horses? Did you ride or have any  
Speaker 2    00:21:24    No, I don't. With horses,  
Speaker 1    00:21:26    I don't.  
Speaker 2    00:21:28    I play <tennis https://www.middleburglife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Photo_02.jpeg>. Yeah. And I ski. It's enough. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:21:33    All those years with horse race, horse trainer.  
Speaker 2    00:21:37    Well, the structure in the horse world of the racing grooms, I could not, it was not appropriate for me to go to the barn and take care of my own horse with all the grooms and everything like that. And it, it just, it, it just had to keep these things separate. Right,  
Speaker 1    00:22:03    Right. What was the, what was life here in Upperville and Middleburg, like in the, was there a lot?  
Speaker 2    00:22:15    Just the same? Was it maybe more parties? <laugh>,  
Speaker 1    00:22:20    Why do you think, huh? Why do you think there are less parties now?  
Speaker 2    00:22:25    I think, well, age people get older and I think also finances  
Speaker 1    00:22:32    Due date and there was more money here.  
Speaker 2    00:22:35    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:22:38    Yeah. Will be February. But there are still a lot of big farms.  
Speaker 2    00:22:41    Oh, right. Yeah. A lot of big farms. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Really nice. Right. And, and, uh, you ready? Now I can remember  
Speaker 2    00:22:50    1223.  
Speaker 2    00:22:53    Mrs. Jones, who had Air Shire used to every year have a major reception on New Year's Day. Really big party. And, you know, everyone just looked forward to that so much that kinda party's kinda gone with the style. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:23:12    Right. What else did you do in the social season here?  
Speaker 2    00:23:19    What,  
Speaker 1    00:23:20    What else did you do in the social season here?  
Speaker 2    00:23:23    Well, I played tennis. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We went skiing in the winter where, and people had little dinner parties and dances sometimes. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. People would have a little diet.  
Speaker 1    00:23:36    It's  
Speaker 2    00:23:36    Just about like it is right now. I mean, it's not, not so different.  
Speaker 1    00:23:41    There were a lot of things that went on at <Buchanan Hall https://visitmiddleburgva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/battle-of-midd-64-L.jpg>.  
Speaker 2    00:23:45    Oh, sure. Just like the place in Middleburg  
Speaker 1    00:23:52    Community Center.  
Speaker 2    00:23:53    Yeah. Community center. Okay. Oh yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:23:57    Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:23:57    <affirmative>. Yes. There's a joy. Safe.  
Speaker 1    00:23:59    What charges  
Speaker 0    00:24:00    About  
Speaker 1    00:24:03    Kinds of, um, development have you seen in the time you've been here?  
Speaker 2    00:24:14    Well, we've kept it over Upperville. As I say, Upperville is a hot bed of social rest <laugh>. And, um, it, it's just about the same.  
Speaker 1    00:24:31    Upperville had a big tizzy about the  
Speaker 2    00:24:35    Had what?  
Speaker 1    00:24:35    Had a big tizzy about the hunter's head at the time. Right.  
Speaker 2    00:24:39    Well that was so funny. Everybody was so upset about that coming. I kept saying, you, you've got it all wrong. I said, it's gonna be a nice place to go out for dinner. So the first night it was over Jimmy Hatcher and I decided to go down and see what all Upperville was there, eating dinner. It was so funny. All the  
Speaker 1    00:25:00    People who had opposed it mm-hmm <affirmative>. In the first place.  
Speaker 2    00:25:04    It's a good place.  
Speaker 1    00:25:05    It is a good place.  
Speaker 2    00:25:06    They're closed this week, apparently. They, uh, they're, they, it looks like they're doing a lot of work inside. I think they're redoing a lot of it. But anyway, it's close this week.  
Speaker 1    00:25:19    I didn't know that.  
Speaker 2    00:25:21    It's a great place though. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:25:22    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Were there more, uh, restaurants in Upperville before  
Speaker 2    00:25:30    Upperville is just too small. There was, uh, there's that with the Hunter's head and then there was one out halfway to Paris. I can't think of what the name of that was. It's, it's an inn out there. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And that's it. That's  
Speaker 1    00:25:50    It. And there's never been anything more in Upperville than a gas station and a  
Speaker 2    00:25:57    Well, it, it's all, all the land is privately owned and people just aren't interested.  
Speaker 0    00:26:04    Mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    00:26:05    <affirmative>. There's a <post office https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50235349742_cd91a3edd5_b.jpg>.  
Speaker 2    00:26:07    You've got the post office.  
Speaker 1    00:26:09    A lot of churches.  
Speaker 2    00:26:10    All churches. And we had a, a big school that burned down, you  
Speaker 1    00:26:14    Know. Oh, I did not know that. Oh yeah. Where was that?  
Speaker 2    00:26:16    So we had a, um, a school up here at the top of the hill and uh, that burned down and they just never replaced it.  
Speaker 1    00:26:26    What kind of school was it? It  
Speaker 2    00:26:28    Was public. It was a public elementary school.  
Speaker 1    00:26:32    So those kids probably go to,  
Speaker 2    00:26:35    Pardon?  
Speaker 1    00:26:36    Where do those children go now? To  
Speaker 2    00:26:38    Hamburg? They came on buses from just like any country school. Right, right.  
Speaker 1    00:26:43    A  
Speaker 1    00:26:43    OL service.  
Speaker 1    00:26:45    Yeah. Do have a lot of the farms in this area turned over? Ownership?  
Speaker 2    00:26:51    Not much. Most people inherit and keep running the farm. Most people live on their farms.  
Speaker 1    00:26:58    1, 2, 6.  
Speaker 1    00:27:00    And are there as many people in the horse business?  
Speaker 2    00:27:06    It's hard to tell. Uh, I, I really don't know. 'cause it's changed. There's so many people that are in the horse business of the show horse business. And I, we had nothing to do with that. And, uh, it's kind of hard to tell. The way to figure it out though, is to go to the Upperville horse show and you see all of Upperville has boxes there. Right,  
Speaker 1    00:27:34    Right. But you have a box at Saratoga.  
Speaker 2    00:27:38    Yeah. Uh,  
Speaker 1    00:27:39    Now are there a lot of people from this area that go to Saratoga to raise their  
Speaker 2    00:27:44    Horses? Pretty much. They don't stay for the whole season, but they'll come. Gordy Keys and Robin come up and, uh, people like that.  
Speaker 1    00:27:57    Do any of, do they race their horses there?  
Speaker 2    00:27:59    Okay. Uh,  
Speaker 1    00:28:01    Or just come for  
Speaker 2    00:28:02    The social depart? Well, it depends. If you have horses and they're good enough to race at Saratoga, you certainly want to race that. If there's a, if the horses meet the conditions and a lot of 'em just come up to see the races and enjoy, enjoy it.  
Speaker 1    00:28:18    Right. Are there trainers here who regularly are at Saratoga?  
Speaker 2    00:28:25    Well, there, there's a circuit and you go and train and race at Belmont or Aqueduct and they closed and Saratoga opens. And so everybody moves up and everybody races in Saratoga. Then that closes, they come back down. And then some people still go to race in Florida.  
Speaker 1    00:28:47    And are there as many trainers here in Middleburg as when you were  
Speaker 2    00:28:51    It's hard to tell. Yeah. The farm Mill built that Marvels training track. Right. And that's always full. And not having any horses for years, I have lost contact with a lot of that. Right. I have no idea how many people live here that train horses.  
Speaker 1    00:29:15    How long do you usually go to Saratoga for now?  
Speaker 2    00:29:20    Saratoga used to be run for a month and now they've expanded it to six weeks because it is doing better than the, the other racetracks downstate.  
Speaker 1    00:29:34    And do you go the  
Speaker 2    00:29:35    Whole time I went, I went, I think I went for a month last, last year. And I stayed. I had real good friends I stayed with and I loved it. And uh, and then they also have grass court tennis up there and I love to play grass.  
Speaker 1    00:29:54    Yeah, there's a beautiful,  
Speaker 2    00:29:55    Yeah. Oh, it's club there, right? Oh, it's lovely.  
Speaker 1    00:29:58    Yeah, I've been there.  
Speaker 2    00:30:00    Yeah. Well, I got up every morning and went over to the track. I, first thing I do when I go to there is I get myself a press pass so I can go any place I want. And, uh, that see not ever not being in racing business anymore. Normally if you have race horses, you have passes start. So I go and register for Middleburg Life for somebody and get a press test so I could go every, any place I want.  
Speaker 1    00:30:29    And then do you write and send back from  
Speaker 2    00:30:33    I call 'em off case. They tell 'em who's there so they can put it in their paper.  
Speaker 1    00:30:39    That's good. Yeah. It is great for you to be able to do that and for the paper. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. To have you without having to pay any someone to go there.  
Speaker 2    00:30:47    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:30:48    Works out well. Um, three seven. When you built this house, you had the plans from that house, right? Had you and your husband designed that?  
Speaker 2    00:31:02    Uh, he had already, when we met, he had actually had this, the designs of the house was finished like that. And we moved in it. And uh, then I just took, and I modified this was an open porch and I closed it in and this has just been my own joy in life.  
Speaker 1    00:31:28    Oh yes. This is a very warm, sunny room.  
Speaker 2    00:31:32    Oh yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:31:32    Like the heart of your  
Speaker 2    00:31:33    House. Yeah. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:31:36    Yes. How many cats do you have? Cats? Do you have more than one?  
Speaker 2    00:31:41    Just  
Speaker 1    00:31:41    That one. Oh. He's just active  
Speaker 2    00:31:43    And, and she, uh, it's funny. Lenny Hale had a little cottage over at the Toka someplace and he was sitting on these front porch one afternoon and this cat was starving and jumped in his lap. So he took her to the vet and had her all done and then brought her for me to keep cat. And I get along really well. We don't know how old she is.  
Speaker 1    00:32:08    I had a cat like that. Yeah. We had no idea how old.  
Speaker 2    00:32:12    Well, she, she's a very independent cat.  
Speaker 1    00:32:15    How long have you had her now?  
Speaker 2    00:32:17    I can't remember now. Maybe eight, five or six years. Not, or longer. 10 maybe. Right. So she's, she's an elderly cat. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:32:27    What, how often do you get over to play tennis? Pardon? How often do you get over to play tennis?  
Speaker 2    00:32:34    I have three regular games a week. So that means that you don't have to call every time. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Just, I had my regular game this morning, obviously was canceled because there was no electricity. Right. Uh, I have a, a match tomorrow playing in the calcu, but I also usually have a Saturday morning game. I have a Monday morning game, a Friday morning game and a Saturday morning game.  
Speaker 1    00:33:04    How many years have you played in the Calcutta?  
Speaker 2    00:33:07    Since it started, I can't remember how long that's been, but we all play every year in the Calcutta. Actually, I wasn't gonna play this year 'cause it takes a lot of time. You have to practice with your partner. And I decided I was gonna give myself a vacation and someone dropped out and they screamed and said, you have to come in to help keep this thing going. So I said, okay. Who  
Speaker 1    00:33:31    Is your partner this year?  
Speaker 2    00:33:35    It's embarrassing. I know her, but I can't remember her name.  
Speaker 1    00:33:38    I can look it up on the sheet, but yeah. Tomorrow maybe I'll come watch.  
Speaker 2    00:33:42    She's, uh, Carla is her name. Carla. We're playing tomorrow at one 30. Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:33:48    Kyla  
Speaker 2    00:33:49    Carla the  
Speaker 1    00:33:50    Professional. That's teacher. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:33:52    The instructor. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah. And her partner dropped out, so to keep her going, so I joined her.  
Speaker 1    00:34:00    She's awfully nice. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Have you ever won the Calcutta? No.  
Speaker 2    00:34:05    Mm-hmm.  
Speaker 1    00:34:07    <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    00:34:10    I, I just sit, go in and the reason I play in the calcu is we have so many new members and that's a good way to meet 'em because they all play in the calcu. And so I always go in so I can meet all the new members. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:34:28    So you, were you a member of the original tennis club?  
Speaker 2    00:34:33    My husband helped found it. You  
Speaker 1    00:34:34    Did?  
Speaker 2    00:34:36    There were 10 of us and we were borrowing people's courts. And so these 10 men decided they would, they went to the bank and borrowed the money and built two courts. You know where the library is? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Well, across the street from the library were two tennis courts. And that was the original tennis pool?  
Speaker 1    00:34:55    Yes. My friend lives in that house actually. Oh,  
Speaker 2    00:34:57    Really? That was the Morgan's old house. <laugh>. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:35:00    And there was, uh, there's still a bar there right. In their house where Right. You all had some good times there.  
Speaker 2    00:35:09    And Annie Morgan loved her telephone. She in the long wire court, she'd bring the phone over by the court <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:35:18    When then did you also help with the tennis club as it is now? Where it is now? When did they  
Speaker 2    00:35:25    Oh, out there? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:35:28    Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:35:29    Well they had a committee and everything and the reason they moved there, it needed to be expanded and Alice Mills sold them the land for practically nothing. That's the major reason we were there, was due to Alice Mills Gen generosity. Right,  
Speaker 1    00:35:47    Right. And when you came, you and your husband both played tennis.  
Speaker 2    00:35:54    Yeah. But he, he was more of a golfer than a tennis player. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:36:02    Ha. The tennis club has grown a lot over  
Speaker 2    00:36:04    The years. Oh yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:36:06    So it originally was 10. Pardon? It was 10 families. Yeah. Who were the other families, do you remember?  
Speaker 2    00:36:13    Oh, let's see. There were the Morgans, the Cle, the Bentleys, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:36:28    Whatever.  
Speaker 2    00:36:29    I'm trying to think of.  
Speaker 0    00:36:31    Paid  
Speaker 2    00:36:32    Gatherers, ambassador of Germany. His family were in it.  
Speaker 0    00:36:36    So I used the credit card as I saw  
Speaker 2    00:36:39    You could look that up.  
Speaker 0    00:36:41    And when things change,  
Speaker 2    00:36:44    <laugh>,  
Speaker 1    00:36:45    I will look that up. What else would you like to tell me about Upperville  
Speaker 2    00:36:52    Next? Upperville is just a hot day social. And you know, it's really interesting, I think, I'm not sure about this, but more people live in Upperville that a descendant of Robert E. Lee than any place. And they all handsome men. Lee must have been a handsome man too. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:37:12    He had a lot of children.  
Speaker 2    00:37:13    Pardon?  
Speaker 1    00:37:14    He must have had a lot of children then.  
Speaker 2    00:37:16    Well, no, Lee, our pavilions now would be his great, great grandchildren. So, you  
Speaker 1    00:37:29    Know. Did he live in Upperville?  
Speaker 2    00:37:32    I think he did.  
Speaker 1    00:37:33    I don't know the, I don't know that  
Speaker 2    00:37:35    The family is from here. Right, right. No, they lived at where the cemetery is now. They own that house in what? Uh, the National cemetery. That beautiful colonial, that was the Lee House  
Speaker 1    00:37:55    In Washington.  
Speaker 2    00:37:56    It's on the Virginia side. Yeah,  
Speaker 1    00:37:58    On the Virginia side. Yeah. Where you can see it when you come across the bridge. Right, right. That was the Lee House. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But they were from Upperville.  
Speaker 2    00:38:06    I don't know whether they were from Upperville particularly, but they were Virginians. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:38:12    Six.  
Speaker 1    00:38:13    So you think a lot of the, what are the issues in Upperville now that people are worried about?  
Speaker 2    00:38:19    I don't know. <laugh>? I have no idea. Oh,  
Speaker 1    00:38:24    You said it was, there was a lot of social unrest.  
Speaker 2    00:38:28    Yeah. But they, um, and you see the Uphill Horse show has goes back over a hundred years too.

Speaker 1    00:39:38    That's very nice. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You're the first lady of racing in Virginia.

Speaker 2    00:40:04    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:40:05    Collected  
Speaker 2    00:40:06    All in one  
Speaker 1    00:40:07    Place. We're trying to get the, you know, businesses, institutions like the tennis club, schools like Hill School and Foxcroft and things that are, um, original to this local area. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 2    00:40:21    <affirmative>. Well, this, this, I commissioned this at Saratoga the first year we were married. No, the first year we were married. We raised in Chicago second year. And I commissioned Jean Boland to paint er, and she took a lot of pictures and everything. And of course she lived right across the mountain so she could come over here and look at the horse and everything. He was retired by then. And that I surprised Sandy and gave that to him for Christmas. Of course. He just loved it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, um,  
Speaker 1    00:41:00    Did you have, uh, then a lot of horses from this horse?  
Speaker 2    00:41:05    Yeah. Oh yeah. We bred him. You  
Speaker 1    00:41:07    Bred him  
Speaker 2    00:41:07    And had alum wine. It amazed me enough. All of Sers Pro all had that same lovely head. They looked a lot alike. Wow. Wow. In fact, we tattooed them so that we could tell 'em apart  
Speaker 1    00:41:24    And, but none of them ever did as well as he did.  
Speaker 2    00:41:29    Well, some of them did pretty well. Seven. Yeah. Because if you don't do well, you're out of business. You have to win a certain amount of money Yeah. And everything. But it was a great advantage to have the racetrack here and be able to ship, just ship race for the day at Laurel and Pen cup. Right?  
Speaker 1    00:41:54    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Right. Because that gave you a lot of experience.  
Speaker 2    00:41:58    Well, gave for your horses. Good for the horses. Right. And also pick up a little money. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:42:05    Was, uh, is does racing pay for itself, were you,  
Speaker 2    00:42:09    Pardon?  
Speaker 1    00:42:09    Were you successful at it? Did racing pay for itself?  
Speaker 2    00:42:14    Oh yeah. Oh, it had to mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then after Sandy died, I realized that I couldn't afford a private trainer and I certainly couldn't train myself. Right. I didn't think I could do that. And so I gradually eased out of the horse business. And I, there're lovely barns over there. You really ought to go over and look. And I leased all those barns to other trainers and things like that. Right. But I figured eventually this is ridiculous. And I managed to sell it and build this house. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:42:55    So it was sort of like the training track is now with barns and a track and you had different trainers in the barns and you  
Speaker 2    00:43:03    Could see you are looking  
Speaker 1    00:43:07    What are the, they're they're growing something  
Speaker 2    00:43:09    D past seal pins Yeah. Is the racetrack. And it's a five eight a mile track. And it used to be have little hell what the shape is now. And we had a starting gate and we could train right there. Right there. And then we have all these barns over here. So this,  
Speaker 1    00:43:30    This is one of them.  
Speaker 2    00:43:30    Yeah. You can see barns.  
Speaker 1    00:43:34    And now it looks like they're growing grapes in the front. Oh  
Speaker 2    00:43:37    My God. I don't know what they're doing, but they, they've got all sorts of high fit protection and everything. And then there was a great big house that Sandy's mother lived in and we had a house that just like this one. And you could, you're looking at my old house, Sandy. You see the front door?  
Speaker 1    00:43:57    Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:43:58    That And it looks just like this house. Yeah, it does. It's very easy. When I built this house to move Right. I knew where all the furniture was going. <laugh> and then Sandy's mother's house. You could see the roof of it. Yes. And the barns were down there and we had her, she had a, a, a sitting room looking at so that she could see them when they led the horses out every day to train 'em and everything. Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:44:24    Did which house over there was built first? The mother's house or Sandy's house?  
Speaker 2    00:44:29    I, oh, I think it was Mrs. McLeod's house. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. That was before I was married. When I was married. She was living there. Mr. McLeod had died and Sandy's house was just finished and we moved right in that.  
Speaker 1    00:44:46    And then when she died, you didn't move over to that house?  
Speaker 2    00:44:49    No, uh, we liked our own house. Right. And we leased it for a number of years mm-hmm <affirmative>. And uh, then I sold the whole package.  
Speaker 1    00:44:59    Right. Do they run horses there?  
Speaker 2    00:45:02    I have no idea what they, I don't see any horses. I don't think so. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:45:06    Service. That was how many years ago did you sell that?  
Speaker 2    00:45:10    Uh, I moved here I think about 15 years ago.  
Speaker 1    00:45:16    Yeah. I think I remember that being sold. Your Christmas tree is pretty.
