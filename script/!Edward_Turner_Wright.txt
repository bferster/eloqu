Title   Interviewed 3/6/20<br>by Lydia Strohl <>
Speaker 0    00:00:00    Your name Temper  
Speaker 1    00:00:01    Turner, right. Born September 6th, 1936. And I was born in Arlington County. Daddy had three sisters married in from this area, boys from this area. And I think they went to Arlington for jobs. So my older brother had some illness and had a doctor in Arlington. So my birth certificates says Arlington County, Virginia. I prefer Loudoun County, but that's where my mother went for my birth.  
Speaker 0    00:00:43    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And where were they living at the time?  
Speaker 1    00:00:47    I'm not positive I, between Foxcroft and Mountville,  
Speaker 0    00:00:52    But Right, right around this area. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:00:54    Yeah. That, yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:00:57    And what did your father do?  
Speaker 1    00:00:59    He was a farmer. And during a great depression, my mother said, you, but you need to get a paying job. So he became the mail carrier and raced around the Mill Road, or didn't race, but went around the mill road to get back to the farm. And he, and he and her brother in law owned a farm, which is part of Camp High Road today, part of the farm. And he accumulated 50 acres here. That's where this house is  
Speaker 0    00:01:37    Today. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:01:39    So he was a farmer at heart, but, um, wasn't any money money on the farm during the Great Depression? I don't think so. I've lived here on this land all my life. Brian and I built on it that they gave my parents, gave us some land. So we had, I think about 11 acres now. After my mother's death, I got some more land. So Brian and I have 29 acres here.  
Speaker 0    00:02:14    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:02:16    So this is home. And this is, uh, live and die here, I hope. <laugh>,  
Speaker 0    00:02:24    Tell me what it was like when you were young to live in Middleburg. What was Middleburg like at  
Speaker 1    00:02:29    The time? Oh, it was wonderful. I went to Middleburg school as I was seven years old because I was small in September birth. So Middleburg, well in Middleburg you knew everybody. You knew, all you knew all the family members. And I went to work for Middleburg Bank in January, 1957. They heard my me, hired me on a six month trial basis. Well, they never got back to me, so I retired 42 years later. Huh. True story. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:03:09    When, at that point in time when you went to the Middleburg School, uh, what grade did that go up to? What, how long were you at the Middleburg school before you went over to Aldi?  
Speaker 1    00:03:23    Eight years. Eight grades.  
Speaker 0    00:03:25    Eight. Eight grades. And then, and  
Speaker 1    00:03:27    I went three years at Aldi in the first graduating class in Loudon County High School, 1955.  
Speaker 0    00:03:37    I bet that was a big deal to consolidate the high schools. I,  
Speaker 1    00:03:39    Yes, it was. Yeah. Yeah. I suppose because I was just a student and I would wait for the school bus out on Route 50. And I'm the second of four children and one brother older, another brother and a sister younger. So we all went to Loudon High School.  
Speaker 0    00:04:04    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Did you take the bus to Aldi school when you went there as well? Yes. Right. And what about Middleburg? Uh, when you went to Burg Elementary School, how did you get to school then?  
Speaker 1    00:04:15    I think Daddy was a mail carrier, so he had the car in the mornings and we had neighbors just short distance from here. And, uh, they would take us, take by say us, my two brothers and sister.  
Speaker 0    00:04:32    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:04:32    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. To Middlebrook School.  
Speaker 0    00:04:34    Where was your parents' house?  
Speaker 1    00:04:36    Two doors  
Speaker 0    00:04:37    Over. Two doors over,  
Speaker 1    00:04:38    Yeah. A pretty stone house.  
Speaker 0    00:04:40    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. That's a beautiful house.  
Speaker 1    00:04:42    So I don't know who owns it today. I don't  
Speaker 0    00:04:45    Know.  
Speaker 1    00:04:46    So Brian and I, my parents gave us right about, about 12 acres to build on mm-hmm <affirmative>. So we have been here since 7 74.  
Speaker 0    00:04:58    And, um, when you went, I imagine you left to go to college?  
Speaker 1    00:05:06    No, I didn't go to college.  
Speaker 0    00:05:08    You didn't go to college?  
Speaker 1    00:05:09    I've took some banking and business courses. Some of those were college credits.  
Speaker 0    00:05:15    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:05:16    But no, that's the only thing in life I've missed. As Brian said, everybody should go to college just for the experience.  
Speaker 0    00:05:26    Well, you got a job right out of high school. You didn't  
Speaker 1    00:05:31    Well, I, um, I'd had a couple of little jobs. I worked in the drug store five and a half days a week. Middleburg Pharmacy. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. It was on Madison Street. And I worked there for a little while, for $25 a week. And I think within five and a half days, I think it was 52 cents an hour <laugh>. So I worked there. And the farmers, they didn't like where I put some perfume. He said, I, I didn't have the top on tightly. And he just raised HELL with me and everybody in the bank, I mean, in the drugstore, said, ed, you shouldn't take that. So it was Saturday and payday. And I got my little pittance of cash and I waited in their back room for the pharmacist to come out. And, um, and um, he came out and I said, I won't use names but Dr.  
Speaker 1    00:06:45    So and so, I don't like the way you've been treating me, and I don't, evidently I'm not doing you a good job. So I said, I, I quit as of now. He said, as of now, I said, yes, sir, good night. And walked out. It took me three months to have enough nerve to go back in the drug store. But we were friends after that a long time ago. Then I heard the Middleburg Bank wanted to hire somebody, started right at the bottom. So I applied for that and I didn't hear a couple weeks and went and talked to the personnel officer. And, uh, I said, I, I haven't heard from you. I, I, uh, I'm not working. If you don't need me, said, please tell me and I'll, I'll look somewhere else. So he left his office and spoke to the, to the president of the bank. And he came back to me and said, when can you start? Well, I said, well, I can start tomorrow morning. So I did. And they hired me on a six month trial basis. Maybe I've already said this,  
Speaker 0    00:08:12    But they never got back to you, so you just  
Speaker 1    00:08:14    Yeah. Never got back to me. So I retired 42 years later.  
Speaker 0    00:08:19    What were you doing when you first started at the bank?  
Speaker 1    00:08:21    I was, worked a few weeks, a few months in the bookkeeping department, then I became a teller, and later I was assistant cashier and then cashier and senior vice president and cashier. So I, I, I wanted to be a banker before then, I had applied for a job at a bank in Leesburg and they said they weren't ready to hire somebody. Well, that worked out great for me 'cause I got a job right in Middleburg. And speaking of Middleburg Bank, the first four presidents were not made paid. They, I wanted Middleburg to have the have a bank and they had independent wealth, independent income that's started there February one or January 57, a long time ago. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And the bank those days was a pretty stone building across the street from the Red Fox. Somebody said, I think I got every job. The older people, older people didn't want. And one of the ladies told, my father said, I think Earl what asked they had to go to the bathroom for him if he could. <laugh>. I had forgotten that <laugh>. Well, he never asked me. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:09:59    Was that building purpose built for the bank? Yeah. And who built that?  
Speaker 1    00:10:04    The first four presidents of Middleburg Bank. I think I said this, were not paid. They wanted Middleburg to have a bank.  
Speaker 0    00:10:12    Who built the original bank? Do you know?  
Speaker 1    00:10:15    Well, I'm not positive. There was an African American builder, will Hall built a lot of buildings. So it might have been Mr. Hall that built that building.  
Speaker 0    00:10:27    Who financed the building of the building?  
Speaker 1    00:10:31    Well, they sold stock. Daniel Sea Sands was absolutely Mr. Middleburg. He was first president of the bank and he was a supervisor for Mercer District. So he was just everything in Middleborough when I was a boy. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I didn't know it then. So God has been good. Uh, so here I am today.  
Speaker 0    00:10:59    What did you do, um, besides go to school when you were young? Did you work on the, the farm?  
Speaker 1    00:11:07    I did some on the farm. I didn't like it. I wasn't a farmer. My younger brother was a farmer.  
Speaker 0    00:11:13    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:11:14    Farmer. Um, bought a large farm in West Virginia. So I, I don't know. What's your question?  
Speaker 0    00:11:25    Um, I was just asking what you did in your spare time when you,  
Speaker 1    00:11:28    Oh gosh. Baseball was a big thing.  
Speaker 0    00:11:31    Baseball. Yeah. Was there a little league here in town?  
Speaker 1    00:11:34    No, not little though. We had what was called Junior League.  
Speaker 0    00:11:37    Junior League. And  
Speaker 1    00:11:38    If you were 16 that year, you'd be too old to play. And you interviewed Claudia. Her father was the manager of the Middleburg Junior League. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:11:50    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:11:51    So the CERs were something else. Just a beautiful family. Claudia has three brothers. Right. They're all deceased now. A wonderful family. I love, I loved them all.  
Speaker 0    00:12:08    You were friends with them growing up? Pardon me? You were friends with them since you were very young.  
Speaker 1    00:12:13    Oh, sure. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:12:15    How did you meet them? Pardon? How did you meet them?  
Speaker 1    00:12:18    Oh, well, just here in town. You knew everybody in town. You, you knew all their family members. It was a small town, so yeah, the Cyphers were a big part of Middleburg. And, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:12:36    Which of the brothers were you? What you were friends with? Doc?  
Speaker 1    00:12:40    Yeah, doc was my younger brother's age. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But as we got older, uh, we, doc and I were good friends. I was in his first wedding in 1960 and I said, oh sure. No wedding. Yeah. The Sers were a big part of Middleburg.  
Speaker 0    00:13:01    And what did you boys do when you were younger for fun?  
Speaker 1    00:13:04    Well, I was in the four H Club and I spent a lot of time grooming a Guernsey calf and, uh, junior league baseball. And we didn't have anything so much organized. We just had fun being together. And in the fall, it's not when I was real small, but as a teenager, the young local boys would meet at the community center and play tackle football. And, uh, only equipment we had was the football. But I don't remember anybody getting, really getting hurt. That was then some of the high school line linemen came, showed up to play. So they big guys. I said, I can't, I don't, I can't handle this. So I stopped playing and I think the group stopped playing.  
Speaker 0    00:13:59    How old were you when you started playing baseball?  
Speaker 1    00:14:03    Oh, I don't know. 10 to 12 years old with my brothers in the back field. You have to be careful sliding. My father had cattle <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:14:20    So the Junior League baseball was played on your land?  
Speaker 1    00:14:24    No, the Agile team had a, had a a P field on the Plains Road across from Boxwood Farm. We Oh yeah. Played them that diamond. And, and then we had on the community center playground, I think the part of that direct lawn is used for other things. But we played tackle football up  
Speaker 0    00:14:54    There. Right behind there. No,  
Speaker 1    00:14:55    I don't, yeah, I don't remember anybody getting hurt badly. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Not at all. I know one of the guys had ticked somebody off and it was said to kick it to Delaney and everybody piled on. Well, we did that. And I remember De Delaney said, what the hell is going on up there? <laugh>? So we had football and we had baseball, and we just had fun being together. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We all knew each other. And, uh, we had Middleburg theater, uh, movie theater. Do you know about that? The location. Okay. We'd go to the movies maybe once a week. Really?  
Speaker 0    00:15:44    The movies changed. Pardon? The movies changed often with a different movie each week.  
Speaker 1    00:15:51    Oh, yeah. Yeah. Maybe, maybe once a week, but not positive. So the movies, and we didn't have to tap anything. We had each other. We just had fun being together. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:16:05    What, what were your other fr the names of your other friends besides Doc?  
Speaker 1    00:16:10    Well, doc, you know Wesley Boxwell? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. John, Patty Bone. And then Friends changed some, but they were the, the ones that I really remember 'em, uh, I was in Doc Sweating Doc and Penny, I was in John Petty Bone's wedding, and we just, just had fun being together. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We didn't have anything ordon and we didn't do anything bad either.  
Speaker 0    00:16:44    Did you, um, I imagine living in the country, you did a lot of things outside.  
Speaker 1    00:16:50    Yeah. That what we, my two brothers and I were in the four H Club, so that's something we did. It seems like I groomed our calf all summer just to get a blue ribbon. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Or a ribbon. So the Four eight Club was a big part of our lives. Never thought of it that way, but I think it was mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:17:14    Did you fish or hunt?  
Speaker 1    00:17:17    No, fished just a little bit. When I was 18 to 20 at McGee's Lake. That's up between Foxcroft and Mountville wasn't a hunter. I couldn't kill anything. I killed one thing and I decided then I don't think I want to do this. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Again, uh, long time ago. And my father was well known for his  
Speaker 0    00:17:48    Baseball. Was he?  
Speaker 1    00:17:49    Yeah. One story I've enjoyed. He told, he played for different teams, different games of different years. And one year he played for Round Hill and they played a team from West Virginia  
Speaker 1    00:18:07    And the West Virginia team won. And a couple weeks later, they played the same team. And Daddy said he went down in the woods to put his uniform on, and he met a man there that he didn't know. So he just figured he was with the visiting team. And Daddy said to him, we, y'all had a pretty easy time of it this two weeks ago. And the man said, yes, we did, but I understand there's a man named Turner right here today. And Daddy said that we won them. So he was well known for his baseball. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. His three sons didn't have that, that skill. And I got to, got to name Ed. His dad, his best friend was Ed Dishman. And he was a star pitcher. Yeah. He probably could have gone to Pro Bowl, but his mother's, his father had died and their mother needed him on the farm. And then Mr. Dishman grew up near Unison Family Farm. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:19:19    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:19:20    And my father grew up on a small farm between Foxcroft and Mountville.  
Speaker 0    00:19:27    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:19:30    And Daddy bought this land in the early fifties. So we had to help us and know I have two brothers, and the three of us had one cow out of milk twice a day. I hated it, but I had to do it.  
Speaker 0    00:19:48    So that the cow was just for your own family. It's just supplied your own family.  
Speaker 1    00:19:54    I sold cream as a matter of fact.  
Speaker 0    00:19:56    You did?  
Speaker 1    00:19:58    Well, we tried, we did sell milk and then the county called it barnyard milk, and we, they let, couldn't sell milk because they sold green, so Yeah. But  
Speaker 0    00:20:09    Where did you sell it?  
Speaker 1    00:20:12    <inaudible> Creamery, I guess they were from Warrenton area. They would come once a week, get the cream, and we had to keep it cool.  
Speaker 0    00:20:21    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Did you keep it in a, in a machine or did you just keep it in bottles in the fridge?  
Speaker 1    00:20:30    No, we had a, maybe a five gallon bucket. And I, you know, I hadn't thought about it. I guess we kept it. My mother had a big refrigerator, freezer kept it in that I didn't like milk in it. I wasn't meant for that.  
Speaker 0    00:20:51    Um,  
Speaker 1    00:20:53    But Middleburg was so wonderful. You knew everybody. If somebody got injured or sick, the whole town knew. It been just a matter of minutes. I think it was so special. I suppose young people that grow up here think the same way. I hope so.  
Speaker 0    00:21:16    Yeah. I think it's still a very special place. Yeah. More people probably. Pardon? Probably more people.  
Speaker 1    00:21:25    Yeah. There, yeah. Number, a few houses that weren't here growing up. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And we had the annual fire department, carnival rides and games.  
Speaker 0    00:21:36    Where was that? I haven't heard about that. It's on  
Speaker 1    00:21:38    The Middleburg School ground. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then later they headed down here at Mercer Hill. I think I'm right on that. The annual carnival. And that was sponsored by the followed Middleburg Volunteer Fire Department. I'm pretty certain That's right. And I joined the fire department in 1960. And my time in the fire department, I responded to the worst fire call in the history of the fire department. Really? And that was the change. The, uh, a gasoline tanker hit the train in the planes. I responded to that, but there's not much we could do. Fairfax and trucks up. And then later the Douglas Fire Fire Department with foam apparatuses to put it out. And then the worst rescue call, I say that up on the mountains, nobody to rescue. They're all dead. 92. Dead  
Speaker 0    00:22:52    92. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:22:54    I stood by a body and we were told to stay there until the proper authorities got to sit by a body. I couldn't tell whether it was man or woman, but it had a man's cuff on his shirt. I couldn't eat meat for three or four days. Mm. You breathing and burning gasoline oil.  
Speaker 0    00:23:17    So that was a part of that same fire?  
Speaker 1    00:23:19    Pardon?  
Speaker 0    00:23:20    Was that a part of the, the gasoline tanker that hit the train? Yeah. The people that died, were they, um, on the train  
Speaker 1    00:23:28    People that,  
Speaker 0    00:23:28    What? The people that died, were they on the train on  
Speaker 1    00:23:31    The plane? I'd say, oh,  
Speaker 0    00:23:32    On the plane.  
Speaker 1    00:23:33    On the airplane. I, yes, I think 92 dead, I believe, if I recall. Don't wait to think of that.  
Speaker 0    00:23:41    Where was it?  
Speaker 1    00:23:43    It was on, uh, what we called the, the, uh, airport road that runs from Route 50 to Route seven. And if it runs further, I don't know. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I don't know the name of that road. That was not a good day.  
Speaker 0    00:24:02    Mm-hmm.  
Speaker 1    00:24:04    I still think about that.  
Speaker 0    00:24:08    Did they know why the plane went down?  
Speaker 1    00:24:11    No, I never heard. No. Just, oh, it was a foggy day. It just didn't clear the mountain. So  
Speaker 0    00:24:19    Had it taken off from Dulles,  
Speaker 1    00:24:21    That was before Dulles was built, I think.  
Speaker 0    00:24:24    Oh, that's right.  
Speaker 1    00:24:25    Probably national. I dunno what airlines, I don't remember.  
Speaker 0    00:24:30    Wow. When, when do you think that was?  
Speaker 1    00:24:36    Oh my gosh. Early 1960 or late fifties  
Speaker 0    00:24:42    Then it was.  
Speaker 1    00:24:44    Yep.  
Speaker 0    00:24:45    Well, if you joined the fire department in 1960. Pardon? You joined the fire department in 1960?  
Speaker 1    00:24:51    No, maybe a little sooner. Maybe in the late fifties. Wasn't much else to do in Middlebrook. So, and I've served on a number of boards here.  
Speaker 0    00:25:02    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:25:04    First Treasurer of Middleburg Library and Secretary of Middleburg Fire Department. So I did a pretty good job on community. And I joined the bank in January, February, I think it was 57. 1957.  
Speaker 0    00:25:28    Did you, once they'd moved you around to several jobs, did you have a certain job in the bank then? Or did you move around your whole  
Speaker 1    00:25:36    Career? Career? I did everything. I started in the bookkeeping department. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And this is before computers. We had a new system. The president at that time, Duncan Reed, READ, and was not paid, had a dependent income. So he was president and hired me. And I think I'd already said they hired me on a six month trial basis. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:26:05    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:26:07    Didn't get back to me. So retired 42 years later. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:26:14    When you retired, what job were you doing at the bank?  
Speaker 1    00:26:17    I was a vice president. I think I was first coming up, moving up the ladder, U assistant cashier, then cashier, vice president, cashier. So I guess I was vice president. I don't know whether I was still a cashier or not.  
Speaker 0    00:26:36    <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:26:38    Don't recall.  
Speaker 0    00:26:40    What, what was your favorite part of working at the bank?  
Speaker 1    00:26:47    Well, I think making loans, helping people. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Things that were important to them. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know, I'm, my philosophy or thought on that was every person comes in the first in the front door of the bank. What they have on their mind is the most important thing I have to do that day. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:27:07    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:27:08    And the first four presidents, I probably said this, were not paid. They just wanted Middleburg to have a bank. So lot's happened since then.  
Speaker 0    00:27:24    Was Paul Mellon involved with the bank? He what? Mr. Mel, Mr. Mellon was involved with the bank.  
Speaker 1    00:27:31    Well, Mr. Mellon and the current president at that time in the late fifties, maybe he shouldn't put this in here.  
Speaker 0    00:27:39    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:27:39    But Mr. Mellon wanted to put an airstrip out near his, the training center. 'cause he built a training center, I think mm-hmm <affirmative>. Or put the money behind. And the president of the bank lived in that area. So he, he was against the airstrip. So Mr. Mellon moved, put the airstrip up to, on his farm, Roka Bay. So I, I, uh, so I think Mr. Mellon pulled out of Middlebrook Bank. Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:28:16    He did.  
Speaker 1    00:28:17    But I remember him coming in and I guess it was Middleburg Hunter. One of the hunts were having a meeting in the second floor room, which was the bank board room and kind of a community room for small, small meetings. So, um, yeah, Mr. Mellon Stone, he did so many wonderful things. The Loudoun Fahe Health Center, he was a mover behind that. And I don't know what he did when the community center was built, I think Mr. And Mrs. Hal Jackson were the big money behind the Middleburg Community Center. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I think Mrs. Mrs. Hal Jackson was Patterson.  
Speaker 1    00:29:10    I may be wrong on this. So they had NCRI might be wrong on that, but Middleburg was just wonderful as Doc ever said. It was mostly fun. <laugh>, that's Claudia's brother. Somebody said, when Dr. Saffer died suddenly of a heart attack, if he was 50, he was early fifties. Somebody said, how can we live without Dr. Ser? He was great. As I said, he coached and financed the Middleburg Junior League. If you were 18, say by March 1st, you too old to play. And I made a good catch one time in the field. I came in and sat on the bench and, and Dr. Sers said, I'm gonna make a ball player outta you yet <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:30:13    So your father didn't coach the baseball? No,  
Speaker 1    00:30:16    But he would help. He would assist a little bit, maybe? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Dr. And Dr. <inaudible>, Ms. Zapper was just a big part of middleburg. Ms. Zapper was active in the Garden club. I think, I think I'm right on that. Claudia mentioned that.  
Speaker 0    00:30:35    Yes. She mentioned the telephone exchange. Where was the telephone exchange? Well,  
Speaker 1    00:30:42    Yeah, you had to download an operator and she would answer. Oh, he, I think she tell 'em what, who you wanted. Don't even know whether have numbers or not. Top of turn where the BNA grocery was. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. On the corner. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Turned right up the hill near the water tower.  
Speaker 0    00:31:02    Uhhuh <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:31:04    That was, uh, I think that's where the operator lived in that household, just spent days there.  
Speaker 0    00:31:13    So it was run out of her house.  
Speaker 1    00:31:17    Somebody's house. I don't know whose house I think, I think, I think,  
Speaker 0    00:31:26    Uh, Claudia told me about a, a young boy who stuck his head out of a bus window and got injured.  
Speaker 1    00:31:36    Do got killed. My brother, younger brother was sitting in right beside him. Really? He had gotten, just gotten his head in. We had community Bible school. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I, they had the use of a school bus, go to all of that area and pick up boys and girls. And my brother was sitting beside the boy that was killed. They had their heads up the windows watching the wheels go. Yeah. Well, brother Tom had just gotten his head in when this boy, I've forgotten who it was. It wasn't a Cockrell. I know it might have been Richard Cockrell. I dunno. Yeah. Tom had just gotten his head in. He had some scratches on his nose. That was a bad time for middle bird. Terrible time.  
Speaker 0    00:32:32    So a a, a truck came up next to the bus?  
Speaker 1    00:32:36    No, I think they met one going east, one west,  
Speaker 0    00:32:39    Another bus,  
Speaker 1    00:32:40    You know, the big truck mirrors. And these guys, the boys, my brother included, had to hit us watching the wheel turn mm-hmm <affirmative>. Or something. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And Tom just had just gotten his head and back in the bus. Bright frightening.  
Speaker 0    00:33:00    Hmm.  
Speaker 1    00:33:02    So, well, baseball was a big time. We, we played junior league baseball. We didn't have Ba Ruth Ba Ruth League. Or if you were 18 by March 1st or something like that, you would be  
Speaker 0    00:33:19    Did they play at Mickey Gordon at the time? Was  
Speaker 1    00:33:22    When that was, that was a farm.  
Speaker 0    00:33:24    That was a farm.  
Speaker 1    00:33:25    The adult league played a, on a field across from Boxwood Farm,  
Speaker 0    00:33:31    Uh, on the side from the Hill School. Pardon? By where the Hill School is?  
Speaker 1    00:33:36    No, it, the land may have been adjoining, I don't know. But uh, yeah, I know where it was.  
Speaker 0    00:33:46    Oh, I know where it is. Yeah, it's still there.  
Speaker 1    00:33:49    You were just there. I  
Speaker 0    00:33:51    It is still there. The, the baseball diamond is still there. Oh, is  
Speaker 1    00:33:54    It Uhhuh  
Speaker 0    00:33:55    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:33:55    Well, they had the adult league there, baseball.  
Speaker 0    00:33:59    And would you go watch that?  
Speaker 1    00:34:01    Oh yeah. And then I played some in the Junior league. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I could run and catch 'em in the field, but I couldn't hit very well. I think I, I was afraid I was going to get hit. I don't know. But Claudia's brother Thornton was a, he had the nickname Doc's father, and Thornton was my best man when he kept, when Brian I married mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:34:25    <affirmative>. Did. And Brian grew up here as well? No,  
Speaker 1    00:34:29    She's from Rocky Mountain, North Carolina. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She came here in 1970, teach second grade at the Hill School. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she brought her first paycheck in the Middlebrook Bank to open an account. I didn't wait on her, but I saw her <laugh> and John Palmer waited on her. I haven't forgotten. It's when Brian got her receipt and left, John said to me, ed, you should have gotten that one <laugh>. True story.  
Speaker 0    00:35:05    So how did you meet her then?  
Speaker 1    00:35:08    I called her and I got up there. I was so shy and so passionate. I called her, she was single and renting an apartment over at Philmont from Phil Thomas. And, uh, I think I called her for a date, but she couldn't go that weekend. So we went the next weekend, started our friendship courtship. So when I got off the phone, she went over to Phil Thomas's house and said, who is the Ed Wright? They left and said, he's got the first dollar I ever made <laugh>. Maybe that's why she married me. <laugh>. Oh. We've been married since 1972. I guess. Maybe two beautiful daughters and three grandchildren. So that I said before God know that God has blessed me with more than I share. But I wasn't gonna tell him. <laugh>. And where did you grow up?  
Speaker 0    00:36:16    I grew up, um, living in different places. Did you? Because my father, uh, had, he worked for one company, but they had different offices. Really? Did you come? So I, I've actually lived in Middleburg longer than I've lived anywhere. Really? Well, good. And I came here, um, 20 years ago.  
Speaker 1    00:36:36    Did you? Well, good for you. And you'll call you a middle burger now. <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:36:42    And my children have been brought up here and they think,  
Speaker 1    00:36:46    How old are  
Speaker 0    00:36:46    They now as home? Um, uh, 15 is the youngest. 15 and the oldest is, um, 29. So, well, you  
Speaker 1    00:36:57    Are a young mother.  
Speaker 0    00:36:58    Big range.  
Speaker 1    00:37:00    It all happened so fast, doesn't it? Scares me a little bit. My family's not buried here. North of, I think I said this Brown  
Speaker 0    00:37:12    Hill. No, you didn't  
Speaker 1    00:37:12    Say it. Brown Hill and Bromont. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Was the other towns. Broomfield. Well, that's gone by name.  
Speaker 0    00:37:20    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:37:21    So that's where I'll be buried.  
Speaker 0    00:37:23    Now, was your, your parents were from here as well?  
Speaker 1    00:37:29    My dad was, my mother came here to teach. It's a two room school in Mountville. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:37:37    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:37:38    So, and that's how Daddy met my mother.  
Speaker 0    00:37:41    Same as you meeting Brian.  
Speaker 1    00:37:42    That's exactly right. Yep.  
Speaker 0    00:37:45    Runs in the family like smart ladies.  
Speaker 1    00:37:48    Yeah. Well, Brian's a good girl. I did. I did well, I did great. So I, like Danny bought this part of the little farm in the early fifties. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And Brian and I decided of 73 or 74, we wanted to bail back here. So you had to have five acres or something like that at that time? I'm not sure. Maybe not that much. So they gave us 12 acres right at it. And then we got some more land afterwards.  
Speaker 0    00:38:25    And how much, when your father first brought, bought this property, how many acres was it?  
Speaker 1    00:38:31    How many  
Speaker 0    00:38:31    What? How many acres did your father have? Well,  
Speaker 1    00:38:33    He accumulated in several purchases. 50 acres. Yeah, 50 acres. And then Brian and I have 29 acres, and I thank God all the time for putting me right here.  
Speaker 0    00:38:50    And tell me, so you've never lived anywhere else but Middleburg.  
Speaker 1    00:38:54    That's right. You know, which is the colonial end building. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. The first year of our marriage, maybe a little more Brown Nine had an apartment there. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she had that short distance to the Hill School. And I walked to the bank and came home for lunch. And we only had 30 minutes for lunch. So that was a good year.  
Speaker 0    00:39:20    Lived right in town. Pardon? You lived right in town?  
Speaker 1    00:39:24    Yeah. That first year.  
Speaker 0    00:39:25    That was your town experience. And  
Speaker 1    00:39:26    That was too much town from here, was it? Yeah, so we, we, my parents gave us some acres and we built on, then I got some more later mm-hmm <affirmative>. So I'm happy here.  
Speaker 0    00:39:41    How has town Middleburg changed over the years?  
Speaker 1    00:39:45    That's a, that's a good question. Well, there are a few more houses, a few more people. The businesses have changed so much. Look, what is the red Fox hill? You know, salamander, the restaurants have changed. The banks have changed. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:40:03    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:40:05    But it's still a great little town. And I think I've already said a, I responded to the worst fire in the history of this area and the rest, rescue and call in history. But that's a long time ago. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:40:23    How long did you serve at the fire department?  
Speaker 1    00:40:26    About 15 years. But the last three I'd gotten married. I'm starting a family, so I wasn't doing anything. So if I couldn't contribute, you just get out. So I, I resigned. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But I had the first 12 years or so, I was active. I was an officer secretary. My younger brother was treasurer. Do you know where the original firehouse was?  
Speaker 0    00:40:58    Yeah. In the middle of the block there?  
Speaker 1    00:41:00    No, it's, well kind of, do you know what was called the Loudon? Falk Hill Health Center? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Right across the street. Right. From  
Speaker 0    00:41:09    That. And then the jail. The jail was down in the basement. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:41:14    To cell jail. Couple of times I went in Saturday morning when I was secretary of the, to some work. And I guess it was a drunk that got up, was yelling, shaking the bars. I said, not enough room here for both of us. So I, twice that happened. <laugh>, I'm sure I was safe. He was locked up.  
Speaker 0    00:41:39    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:41:40    I still still got out.

We never thought about color. I may have been one of the first to help open the doors for the African. I can't say that. 'cause I don't know who else.  
Speaker 0    00:50:56    Right. Might,  
Speaker 1    00:50:57    Might say that. But I knew the people knew the families.  
Speaker 0    00:51:02    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:51:04    And my father was well known because of his baseball skills.  
Speaker 0    00:51:10    Was the baseball an integrated effort? Were there African Americans that played baseball with him?  
Speaker 1    00:51:16    I don't remember any African Americans. I don't remember when they really started playing because I'd gotten away from it and raising two daughters. So  
Speaker 0    00:51:27    Not close. I didn't need to all we're fine. Okay. Should talk. Well. Want  
Speaker 1    00:51:36    Go. We are doing well. Having fun. Yeah. Speaking of baseball, I look over here.  
Speaker 0    00:51:43    Oh, there's your baseball picture. Yes. This is,  
Speaker 1    00:51:47    I've gotten old. It's not worth a damn.  
Speaker 0    00:51:49    Shh. <laugh>. Let's see.  
Speaker 1    00:51:55    This is the middle bird baseball team.  
Speaker 0    00:51:58    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:51:59    I think probably 1921 maybe. And this is Unison High School. That could be 1912 to 1914.  
Speaker 0    00:52:10    So that's your dad's team?  
Speaker 1    00:52:11    Yeah. This is dad right here. And his best friend was Ed Dishman. That's where my name comes from. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He was a star pitcher. One of my favorite stores was Daddy played for different teams, different games. And he, they played for Round Hill. He said, maybe I've told you this, I'll tell you.  
Speaker 0    00:52:38    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:52:39    And, uh, I don't think, did I tell you that? Said he went down the woods to put his uniform on.  
Speaker 0    00:52:46    There was no place to change?  
Speaker 1    00:52:48    No. He just went down the woods out of, away from the spectators. And he said there was a man that he didn't know, played a team from West Virginia.  
Speaker 0    00:52:58    May I see.  
Speaker 1    00:52:59    And, and they played that team a couple weeks before. And the West Virginia team won. And Daddy said, well, he didn't know him, so he figured this guy was with the visiting team. And the daddy said, well, y'all had a pretty easy time for the other game. And the man said, yes, we did. But I understand there's a man named Turner right here today. And Daddy said we won too. And here's  
Speaker 1    00:53:36    Daddy's right here. And this must be Ed Dishman. Who named left?  
Speaker 0    00:53:42    May I see? Tyler,  
Speaker 1    00:53:43    Tyler Gore's father-in-law. Peggy Gordon Gore. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:53:48    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:53:49    Would've been on that team.  
Speaker 0    00:53:50    They're good looking boys. Which is your dad here with the, right here. Right here. Is he in this picture? Pardon? Is he in this picture as well?  
Speaker 1    00:54:03    Yeah. Do I have it? Yeah. Yeah. Brian framed this  
Speaker 0    00:54:09    Right. Is is your dad in this photo or just there?  
Speaker 1    00:54:13    No, he's in both of these.  
Speaker 0    00:54:14    Which is he in this, this  
Speaker 1    00:54:16    His dad in Middleburg team. And this is Unison High  
Speaker 0    00:54:20    School. That's him there. Let's see.  
Speaker 1    00:54:26    I don't see him.  
Speaker 0    00:54:27    No,  
Speaker 1    00:54:31    I don't see my father  
Speaker 0    00:54:34    Does it here. Works  
Speaker 1    00:54:35    Down here.  
Speaker 0    00:54:37    There he is.   
Speaker 1    00:54:41    Yeah. He was known for his baseball skills.  
Speaker 0    00:54:44    So he started playing baseball in  
Speaker 1    00:54:47    For Unison High School.  
Speaker 0    00:54:50    So in high school he started playing.  
Speaker 1    00:54:52    Yeah. Then later he played for Middleburg. And he paid, played for other teams, played flip games for Round Hill,  
Speaker 0    00:55:00    Uhhuh. <affirmative>,  
Speaker 1    00:55:01    Maybe I've already said this.  
Speaker 0    00:55:02    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:55:03    And uh, he went there, new Woods put his uniform on. Did I say this? And the man said, I understand there's a felony turner right here today. And Daddy said we won too. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:55:20    This is about Confederate Hall.  
Speaker 1    00:55:23    Yeah, Mr. Mills. That was where the Exxon station, where the pumps are in that area. The, and later when the Exxon was moved back on that lot.  
Speaker 0    00:55:37    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:55:38    And Mr. Mills Abel's, his father-in-law. What was I gonna say?  
Speaker 0    00:55:49    Did they,  
Speaker 1    00:55:50    Mr. Mills bought the Confederate Hall and moved it over to his farm, just out on the Plains Road.  
Speaker 3    00:56:01    Some nice parties there. Yeah. Have you ever been to parties out there? You haven't? Oh, there's a really nice venue. If you ever want to have, um,  
Speaker 0    00:56:10    It's still there. Oh, yes.  
Speaker 3    00:56:12    You, you don't know what Confederate Hall is. Mm. That was pretty important. What did they do at Confederate Hall? Ed? I'm not so sure what, what the purpose of that was.  
Speaker 1    00:56:21    The community center, I guess meeting place.  
Speaker 3    00:56:25    Was it like a community? Was it there before the Community Center, do you think?  
Speaker 1    00:56:31    I would, I don't know. That would be very, I can guess. I'd  
Speaker 3    00:56:34    Say  
Speaker 0    00:56:35    I, I would think it was because the community center was, I think it was  
Speaker 1    00:56:38    Before the Center.  
Speaker 0    00:56:38    Right.  
Speaker 3    00:56:40    And that was probably the meeting place. Um, did you speak to, um, uh, what is the place right across from the Red Fox? The  
Speaker 1    00:56:52    Middle bird bike?  
Speaker 3    00:56:53    No, no, no, no. The, the, the where everybody used to live. The, the  
Speaker 0    00:56:58    Colonial Inn.  
Speaker 3    00:56:59    The Colonial Inn. Colonial Inn. Yeah. I guess you know all the stories about that. They were wonderful stories about that. That, so I  
Speaker 1    00:57:06    Know several young couples had apartments there. I think Apartments. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:57:11    <affirmative>. You lived there?  
Speaker 3    00:57:13    Well, we, we lived behind there. Yes. We didn't actually live because it was not  
Speaker 1    00:57:17    In the same building.  
Speaker 3    00:57:19    Was Well, I suppose it was. Yeah. Um, where we lived the first year. But we had an apartment that was outside the end. It was not like you had a room. Right. And, and, and the end. But that wasn't that a kind of a hot, fun place to go to, weren't they? Yeah. I understand. They had,  
Speaker 0    00:57:37    They had a dining room there,  
Speaker 3    00:57:39    Gaity there.  
Speaker 1    00:57:40    A lot of what  
Speaker 3    00:57:41    Kids? People were happy and they had fun. Um, so that, that, that would be a very interesting avenue to travel to see, because who lived? Who there? You said, you  
Speaker 1    00:57:53    Said why else? But I don't know who's living that way.  
Speaker 3    00:57:56    Well, but who,  
Speaker 1    00:57:57    Who owns that building now?  
Speaker 3    00:57:59    Oh, honey, it's changed two or three times. Remember when Jacqueline Watson had  
Speaker 1    00:58:04    Some Thomas on it?  
Speaker 3    00:58:06    He probably owned it too. He home kind of everything. Um, no, he  
Speaker 1    00:58:11    Didn't. Not that much.  
Speaker 3    00:58:13    Well, important places in Middleburg at the time that he's, he's touched them. Um, he and Tim Demas. Um, Tim probably has so much to offer, you know, just about the history. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and, um, just because he owned so many buildings, um, I, and he comes with, um, accuracy too, being a lawyer. Did you, uh, <laugh>, which is fine. You never know <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:58:42    Yeah. This is not Confederate  
Speaker 1    00:58:44    Hall. Did you come stop till open when you  
Speaker 0    00:58:45    Came? Oh yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:58:46    And of course an early name for it was the New York Cafe. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:58:50    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 3    00:58:52    And the Hamburger Hut. Right, right. Um, my girls even remember that it was used to be called the ut the hamburger. Ut because the H  
Speaker 0    00:59:01    Fell off the side. Right.  
Speaker 3    00:59:02    <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:59:03    You age? Hamburger. Ut <laugh>. The  
Speaker 3    00:59:05    Hamburger, UT Hamburger Hut. The hamburger ut <laugh> both ages fell. So, so that, you know, that's kind of, uh, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:59:16    Yeah, the, the Confederate Hall was built in 1907 and then it was moved in 1972. So you, did you have dances there before the community center was,  
Speaker 1    00:59:29    I didn't go there. And, uh, but no.  
Speaker 0    00:59:32    Did you go to dances when you were in high school?  
Speaker 1    00:59:35    No. I was so much. I might, I went to 'em. Yes. I probably didn't dance. <laugh>  
Speaker 3    00:59:41    <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:59:43    Where would those have been?  
Speaker 1    00:59:45    Middlebrook School Auditorium. And then of course, this community center was 48. I was 12 that year. Right. So, so that, that's where they'd go to the community center. Then  
Speaker 3    01:00:00    Ed was president there for a bit, just a little bit. And Ann on the tennis club, he, he did a little bit of any interesting stories about the tennis club. Oh, he was president of the Wild Turkey. Nobody knows this. The Wild Turkey. What?  
Speaker 1    01:00:17    That's the wild Turkey Tur. I i  
Speaker 3    01:00:20    Society, but not a  
Speaker 1    01:00:21    Society. It's the Wild Turkey Club. The club. I have two, two buddies and I went up to the club and drank too much Wild Turkey. We, we, uh, we had quite a time paid for it the next day, <laugh>.  
Speaker 3    01:00:42    And when, uh, Mary Houston, uh, was born, I said I was in the hospital delivering, 'cause she was born on the same day as he. And so I left his, uh, uh, gave it to him. You and my white gown in the hospital. <laugh>. I had a birthday cake brought in that said Happy birthday Daddy and, and baby. 'cause I didn't know. Right. She was to be a girl. But then I gave him this little white tag, and it was a treasure hunt. And he had, he had to go all over the house looking at, it was a bottle of the fines. Wild Turkey. They were making the highest proof <laugh> in honor of being present. And nobody knows that that, but president of the Wild Turkey Club at the tennis club. So that was good. But also put on the no Jordan board. And did you tell her that you went the, did you do any firehouse stories? He was, he told you about that. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:01:37    House stories.  
Speaker 3    01:01:38    So you know the firehouse stories? Oh  
Speaker 1    01:01:41    Yeah.  
Speaker 3    01:01:41    Yes he did. So those were interesting times too. Um, yeah,  
Speaker 1    01:01:44    The firehouse was on Matters street. And, uh, I responded to the worst fire in the history of the area. And I responded to the worst rescue call Nobody to rescue 92 girl playing. I could sit by a per body, could just couldn't tell. This man and woman had a man's cuff. I couldn't eat meat for three days.  
Speaker 3    01:02:12    And he was a good member. Except if it was a pregnant woman.  
Speaker 1    01:02:17    If it was  
Speaker 3    01:02:18    What? A pregnant woman. And there was another, a person who was on the call to go to the hospital with this woman. He would say, I'm driving. In other words, you get in the back with her <laugh>. That's,  
Speaker 1    01:02:35    I remember walking, I remember you said Bobby. Bobby, uh, Bobby Picketts dead. And  
Speaker 3    01:02:41    He, yeah, he dead.  
Speaker 1    01:02:42    Bobby uh, stuttered. He terribly. And, uh, he was, he got to the firehouse before I did and pulled the ambulance out. And I said, Bobby, I'm going, but I'm driving  
Speaker 3    01:02:59    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:03:00    So we loaded this lady in the ambulance and I look up and Bobby's under the wheel. Bobby, I'm not getting in until you get out  
Speaker 3    01:03:09    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:03:10    Well, he got out after a few minutes, but we got to the hospital. No  
Speaker 3    01:03:15    Problem. Did you tell Lydia the joke about the back? This is a funny joke. I think you might have enjoyed the, the, um, uh, when you, the joke about the person who came into the bank, every, this was in Leesburg and he would say drunk again. Uh, what, what was that thing?  
Speaker 1    01:03:35    Yeah, the person in the bank was open opening up the front door, opening up the bank for business. And he met the found drunk there, standing outside. And the president said, drunk again. And the drunk said, me too. <laugh>.  
Speaker 3    01:03:54    He's got some funny stories. Did you tell her about the guy that wanted the pig when you were a banker?  
Speaker 1    01:04:02    Well, yeah. There's a couple African Americans on kind of winos, but good people.  
Speaker 3    01:04:07    <laugh> winos were good  
Speaker 1    01:04:08    People. And, uh, I've forgotten the story.  
Speaker 3    01:04:12    Well, he wanted to buy a pig, you said?  
Speaker 1    01:04:15    Yeah. Well, where else was a wino and where are you buying the pig such and such? And then I said, okay, then I'll make the check to them. We went, went through this two or three times and he finally said, won't be 15 <laugh>.  
Speaker 3    01:04:36    Because he started high, right? I think high. And he had, and he had a stutter too. That was  
Speaker 1    01:04:41    Something I couldn't, I couldn't, yeah.  
Speaker 3    01:04:44    He had a lot of  
Speaker 1    01:04:45    Loan Be 15 <laugh>.  
Speaker 3    01:04:47    He, he started high, went low. 'cause they had knew that he was just gonna walk right over going  
Speaker 1    01:04:52    To the liquor store.  
Speaker 3    01:04:53    Right. We had some characters. We really did. And Louie Duffy was a character too. Have you heard that name? Louie Duffy? I don't know. All I remember about Louie Duffy when I came here was that he had always wore a green blazer with a carnation and he would walk the streets. 'cause usually he had drunk so much he couldn't find his car. Much less driver's car. But he, you know, Louie Duffy? He, he was, there was some interesting town, town characters.  
Speaker 1    01:05:23    Well, Mr. Duffy's family had some money.  
Speaker 3    01:05:25    Yeah, he had money.  
Speaker 1    01:05:26    And, uh, what he had, we call it Alzheimer's today. I guess what, he was funny.  
Speaker 3    01:05:35    Did you tell him about Gyp g Crohn's, uh, Crohn's, uh, about the speeder that went through Middleburg. That was a funny thing too. But  
Speaker 1    01:05:44    Chief CR was a police chief. Did I tell you that one? Yeah.  
Speaker 3    01:05:47    Well, the, the, the, the thing that,  
Speaker 1    01:05:50    Well, I didn't finish it. Maybe I did. So John Powell was talking to Chief Kron, who's that police chief before going to work. The coach stop was middle of the street. I don't know what's there now across from Middleburg Real estate. He  
Speaker 3    01:06:07    Might be gone. It's, uh,  
Speaker 1    01:06:08    Anyway, John could have said the car had to be going 35 miles an hour or 45. He said, look at that Jeep, our police chief. He said, oh, don't worry about it. It'll be outta town in 15 seconds.  
Speaker 3    01:06:24    <laugh>. But there was not, mine's not working that there was some town characters that were funny. And just do, I mean, you have to be careful when you start writing about people, because you never know how <laugh> the family's gonna respond. But they were funny town characters and everybody accepted them just like Louis Duffy. And,  
Speaker 1    01:06:52    Well, the Duffys were,  
Speaker 3    01:06:54    And they didn't worry about it.  
Speaker 1    01:06:56    This fellow Duffy, you talking about his father was on the board of Middleburg Bank.  
Speaker 3    01:07:01    Yeah. And, uh, and, and, uh, it, they were kind and funny and easy.  
Speaker 1    01:07:09    He still got family here, so don't use that.  
Speaker 3    01:07:12    Yeah. But there, there, it, it, it was a, it was a whole different kind of, um, small community feeling. You know, this is such a transit time now, and people are coming and going and, and that's just the way it is.  
Speaker 1    01:07:29    That's, that reminds me of another story. When Middleburg Bank was original bank was the stone building across from the Red Fox. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. When we built the new bank, somebody asked, why are they building a new bank as the old one fought  
Speaker 3    01:07:44    <laugh>, why  
Speaker 0    01:07:47    Did you build the new bank? Pardon? Why did you build the new bank?  
Speaker 1    01:07:52    Why did I,  
Speaker 0    01:07:53    Why did,  
Speaker 1    01:07:53    Well, I was, uh, I wasn't, I was young, 19 or 20 and I wasn't working, I was working for a construction company. Well, winter came and no work. So I heard the bank was looking for somebody to start at the bottom. So I applied for the job and the person I talked to, the cashier, Earl Dawson, got out of his seat and went across aisle to the press president and came back and said, when can you start? I said, I could start tomorrow. He said, okay, we'll hire you on a six month trial basis. Well, they never got back to me. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So I retired 42 years later. First four presidents were not paid.  
Speaker 0    01:08:49    Why did they move the bank from the building in the middle of town to the new building?  
Speaker 1    01:08:54    Well, if somebody asked that question, they wanted to know why they moving the bank is the all one full  
Speaker 3    01:09:01    <laugh>. But they, she really wants to  
Speaker 1    01:09:03    Know, needed needed a bigger bank. More people,  
Speaker 0    01:09:07    More people, more space.  
Speaker 1    01:09:10    They were my fondest banking members. That's Mr. Dawson. That's Reggie Dawson's great uncle. I said, why? Oh, somebody said, I, I think Earl would ask Ed to go to the bathroom for him if he could.  
Speaker 3    01:09:29    Oh, ed,  
Speaker 1    01:09:30    What,  
Speaker 3    01:09:32    How did you, have you talked with the Reuters? Because I know they have, you know, any of those folks would have a lot of input to, um, stories, but changes that they've seen. Right. Well,  
Speaker 1    01:09:45    Honey, they were all the people, Dr. Ro property practice, Washington. I guess  
Speaker 3    01:09:52    That, that, that would be a, a good lead I would think to fall, because just the access and the experiences they've had, they could be some funny, very interesting things. It just depends on whether you want to go through the historical thing or really the life of. Right.  
Speaker 0    01:10:12    How did, how did you find out about the Hill School?  
Speaker 3    01:10:16    Well, I guess I was just supposed to come to Middleburg. You know, I'm a North Carolinian and, um, I went to a teacher's college. Um, the small one, I only went to girls schools. I went to St. Mary's, which was Episcopal Girls School. And then I went to Greensboro College, which was not the large women, but it was just, I mean the large women. But it was a smaller co college for women. But it was a school. I think there were about 94 to 96% were all in elementary education of the entire school. And there were a few that did music education, <laugh>. There were the rest of 'em, but they still were the education. So I went and, um, I really wanted to teach at an Episcopal school. And, um, so I started applying to all, as my roommate would say, the Saints, Saint Catholic, saints saint this saint that all the schools. And, uh, it just, they were not, it was a time that they were not hiring for that particular age level. So, uh, I did receive one from one saint. They said, oh, you sound wonderful. I, there's a fellow in Middleburg, Virginia that's looking for a teacher.  
Speaker 3    01:11:37    And I said, well, alright. So I kept waiting for the saints, but the saints were not appearing. So I came up here and looked at the village and said, this was, this is just perfect. And I, the name Ms. Ann Al, are you familiar with that name? Interesting gal. This is, if you ever want to go get a little info from the Hill School is, she was the head mistress for the lower school at that time. And she had been in the military and she ran that first grade about the same way as she was, I don't know whether she was a sergeant or corporal or something. But when Ms. Ann said something, you listened and you learned, and I taught second grade. It was very, very easy to teach second grade after Ms. Anne had had them. Because one, they were not only obedient, they knew all the rules and the, especially the phonetic stuff, she was incredible.  
Speaker 3    01:12:40    But, um, anyway, Ms. Anne had a long legacy there at the Hill School. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, um, was important in the development of that school. And a lot of people don't know that Ed had something to do with the Hill School. He never was on the board. But I credit to this one who came, who owned that property, right at the Hill School Clark, when Clark, Steve Clark. Yeah. When Steve Clark came in to talk with Ed, he said, what are you going to do with that piece of property? He said, I think you need to, to talk to somebody about maybe giving it, which he did.  
Speaker 1    01:13:19    I don't remember that.  
Speaker 3    01:13:19    Well, you told me that. I, and I, that's the story that he, you know, he probably went and said, you know, I can write this off. It's a box squad farm. Uh, I can write this off and it would be going to a good cause. And this seems like a smart move. And he did. But Ed was the one that had suggested it to Steve Clark. I'm, I'm sure other people did too. But the Hill School has enjoyed that property. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And needed it and used it. 'cause it was, became a <crosstalk>.  
Speaker 1    01:13:49    Steve Clark's father, I think it was father, started and gave the baseball Hall of fame.  
Speaker 0    01:13:55    Really? And they were from the, they're  
Speaker 1    01:13:59    From Costone.  
Speaker 0    01:14:00    I see. Huh. And did you continue to teach once the girls were born?  
Speaker 3    01:14:08    Uh, no. Nope. I had to build a house. Um, but after I got married, uh, built a house. Well, I stayed another year or two there, but, um, needed to have a family and didn't want to do that at the same time. It was too much juggling of stuff. And, um, so, um, I waited about four or five years and then Ed said to me, <laugh>, what would you like for Christmas? And I said, would you buy me a little school? And he did. So he bought me a school for Christmas and gave it to me. It was at a  
Speaker 4    01:14:44    Cocktail party. And I, and that's why one day I taught your son <laugh>, all because of a cocktail party. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    01:14:55    And where was your school when you started it?  
Speaker 3    01:14:57    Well, it really was an outgrowth of the Alder Nursery School. This gal, um, a Anna Ick mm-hmm <affirmative>. That taught also in Middleburg  
Speaker 0    01:15:07    School. Yeah, I saw that.  
Speaker 3    01:15:09    Um, and Shirley Hutchinson had that little school in Aldi long before it was the only preschool other than Miss, um, miss Wils, Mrs. Wilson. She had a school there and she was kind of a, a tough character from what I understand. Um, but, um, and the children just didn't, I don't, I don't know. I I I just understand she was a tough cow. And, um, so, uh, my children went to the, all the nursery school and they were ready to retire higher. So the timing was just Right. Perfect. Yeah. So I did a little subbing and I liked the parents and liked the children, and it just, so they needed to move it. So I moved it to a manual Episcopal church. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then when we became a little larger, we had to go from larger rooms and more property and more availability. And, you know, at that time the room sale was coming in, you know, it was a change. And then the Christmas shop came in and it was a change. Right. So, you know, um, it, the, the church was plenty busy and, but so stayed there 10 years and then went to the Baptist church and the Methodist Church and then Baptist. So we moved about, depending upon how we needed properties. Right. I wanted to be under church roof of that was a big thing. Right. I wanted it to be, I didn't want to own it. Uh, somebody, excuse me, someone else owned it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And that was, that was Jesus.  
Speaker 4    01:16:41    I just needed to work  
Speaker 0    01:16:42    <laugh> and love October. Right. That's all I needed to do. And this is about Mr. Mellon too. Where did you say you live now? I live in Rectortown right next to a big piece of property. That's Mr. Mellon's actually. So it's what we live right next to a big, big piece of Mr. Mellon's property. Oh, really? So we're pretty  
Speaker 1    01:17:09    Well protected.  
Speaker 0    01:17:10    We, we have only two acres, but we have a nice view because of Mr. Mellon putting it in. Oh.  
Speaker 1    01:17:20    Well I thank God all the time for putting me right here.  
Speaker 0    01:17:24    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:17:24    We could be anywhere, but we are here.  
Speaker 0    01:17:30    Yeah. It's,  
Speaker 3    01:17:33    You know, my sister, your sister has called Eleanor, and that was my sister who called, who is traveling.

Speaker 1    01:18:18    Brian is B-R-Y-A-N. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 3    01:18:21    I, my those  
Speaker 1    01:18:22    Two pictures.  
Speaker 3    01:18:23    Which ones sweetie? The  
Speaker 1    01:18:25    Middlebrook baseball team and the Unison.  
Speaker 3    01:18:27    Oh, right here. Dar  
Speaker 0    01:18:29    And where were you born?  
Speaker 3    01:18:30    In Rocky Mount. Can you believe such a place? North Carolina? Because it is a rocky Mount Virginia. Right,  
Speaker 0    01:18:37    Right.  
Speaker 3    01:18:38    And probably there are a lot of rocky mounts all over. But, um, anyway, we still, my sister and I still have a farm there mm-hmm <affirmative>. And at one point, of course it was a tobacco farm, and now they're growing all sorts of interesting things, soybeans and stuff. I don't know. I'm trying to talk. In fact, I was, y'all went here, I was trying to talk with a tax person in North Carolina. Um, so, um,  
Speaker 0    01:19:02    So you're both from farming families? That's  
Speaker 3    01:19:04    Interesting. Well, um, and I, I didn't live on a farm. We just had the farm. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We lived in, in, in, in, in Rocky Mount. My father had business otherwise. And, uh, but it, it was a good time. It was a good time. I think, you know, I think I look back and one of the, and it's so interesting, Lydia, when I talk with the teachers now that were at the school, they said they were some of their happiest times. We had such a happy, happy time with those children. There was the, the memories we have, remember, I don't know if, if you remember people like Ann Herndon, who was just, she just says every time she says, and John, uh, and Denise, you know, and the way, the reason why Kathy Hartley owed her little venture through that is of one day she came to pick up her child.  
Speaker 3    01:19:58    'cause I taught both of their children. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She came to pick up her child. Maybe it was another child. It was at the Baptist Church. I don't remember. 'cause we were on the playground and she said, hi, sweet. Because she looked over the fence and she saw the child. She said, hi, sweet Pink. And I turned around and said, who said that? And Kathy looked, I talked Kathy <laugh>. And that funny. I said, who said that? That's David, but that's Claudia's daughter. Yes, that's right. That's, and so I said, who said that? And Claudia said, I mean, what's her name? Kathy. Kathy. Kathy said, I said it like, I, I reprimanded. I said, I want you to come and teach. She said, but I haven't been trained to teach. I said, oh, that's easy. I can teach you how to do that.  
Speaker 0    01:20:48    And then she had a long career in three places  
Speaker 3    01:20:51    Just because she said, hi, sweet pea. I love that she loved the children that much. And I said, but I don't know how that's easy. Just watch what we do. Right. And be careful at cocktail parties because they would, you know, do So what  
Speaker 0    01:21:08    She, she taught K So Denise taught Cade Yes. At your school. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then Kathy taught Cade at kindergarten. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then Denise came to the Hill School mm-hmm <affirmative>. And taught him two more times. Two more years. Uhhuh, <affirmative>, Uhhuh, <affirmative>. So you know, it. And,  
Speaker 3    01:21:23    And I, yeah. Just, um, and it was, we were all working and grooming each other together. And we had such fun,  
Speaker 0    01:21:33    I I don't remember any bad times there, you know? Sure. There were the things like, you know, he wouldn't wear his shoes to school. Oh.  
Speaker 3    01:21:41    But that was just, he didn't wanna do it, but Right. He thought that was no big deal.  
Speaker 0    01:21:44    Right. But, but I'm saying that's like the worst of it. There were there just, it was at such a happy place.  
Speaker 3    01:21:49    It was a, it was a easy, happy place.  
Speaker 0    01:21:52    It wasn't demanding it, I don't remember, you know, now I feel like this place where he used to go to camp, I know that the parents now, they think, oh, they're not learning enough. Well, you know, they were learning to be happy to get along with one another. Right. To be respectful of adults. They're learning a lot. You know, not, they were learning things, not math, but <laugh>,  
Speaker 3    01:22:16    They, they were learning what they needed  
Speaker 0    01:22:19    To learn. Learn. Right. They were learning to be people  
Speaker 3    01:22:22    For life. And they were also learning about who they were and when, when they were, and who they were and how they were responded, and how they should respond to other people. But how they should, not what they were to respond, but how they should respond to other people. And just being kind and loving and having fun.  
Speaker 0    01:22:48    And those children are all very successful children.  
Speaker 3    01:22:52    Well, they were my children, you know, that I was, I always felt like they were all of my grandchildren. Every single child. And I gotta tell you a quick little story that has nothing to do with, with this, but Kingsley Phantom. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Do you know, Kingsley Flore was, was at the school. And we had, you know, the Christmas pageant was a time that we started because there really weren't any Christmas programs for children. And, um, so we, we started it with our little school. And I figured this is a Christian school, and people will have to bite the bullet if they don't really want to go there with it. Or they can go, they can find a place, they would be happy. It's not like I had a problem with number one, when did everybody be happy? But Kingsley Phan, there was so many sweet little pageants there.  
Speaker 3    01:23:42    And, and the, the children felt so good. And it was the, we, we got a chance just not to concentrate on what they were getting and being in the excitement of the moment, which you want children have that excitement, but actually to, um, to see what, why we're celebrating Christmas. And there was a story I popped in. I was gonna go see Gloria just to take her. Oh, I've got something for you. Um, and don't let me forget it. Um, I was just gonna pop in and give her a little gift and tell her that I was thinking about her. And, um, I, I had forgotten that Kingsley had moved into their house. And, but I mean, I knew that 'cause I'd been up to a party Right. In the new house. I'd just forgotten that, you know? Right. It was Christmas. How can you, you always, I always lose my, you were on, you were on autopilot.  
Speaker 3    01:24:38    Well, why I lose my car keys? Our credit card. Every Christmas is just the, the way it is. So anyway. And I saw Kingsley. Now Kingsley is tall. Now, have you seen Kingsley recently? Yes. She is tall, beautiful and tall. And then, um, I, I saw Kingsley and I said, Kingsley, I haven't seen you in years and years and years. But again, she was one of my children. And she, there was a child in, in Kingsley's cat class named, um, I think his name was Cole. And he was a child that struggled with many things. Beautiful mother, beautiful child. But he had a lot of difficulty with social situations. I don't remember him. Well, that's good. Probably because he, he couldn't become a bigger part of, easily, so you wouldn't remember him. But Cole, um, uh, Kingsley was very kind. And I wanted Kingsley. See, I still couldn't go back and grab these children and say, let me tell you what you did.  
Speaker 3    01:25:45    'cause I remember 'em all. I said, Kingsley, do you remember a little boy in your class named Cole? She had to think about it. She said, yeah, I think I did. I said, you don't know how important you were to that child. And I want it here. I mean, here I've got almost a grownup. She's almost a grownup. She's a such a young lady. Now that she's almost a group. I said, I said, you don't know how important you are. And I said, I want you to remember that this is, this is Christmas time. And I started had, you know, be the teacher that I come up. So I said, let me tell you the story. You might remember it. Everyone had special parts. And, and that was really what they could do. For instance, Mary was not the most important person. She was like the, the pretty sweet little girl that did everything you said, but couldn't sing mm-hmm <affirmative>. Because she didn't have to sing. But she could be sweet and beautiful and be just the person she needed to be. So I was  
Speaker 4    01:26:42    Casting this  
Speaker 3    01:26:43    The best that I could. The person who you could, you know, like ca was, he was a Wiseman. I know that.  
Speaker 4    01:26:49    So, but he was came, he was God. One year. I have a program that says, ca God, God,  
Speaker 3    01:26:55    We, he was a Wiseman. He was God the person. You know why? Because he would stay still. God had  
Speaker 4    01:27:03    To be  
Speaker 3    01:27:04    Had one,  
Speaker 4    01:27:05    He had to not fall off that chair. Right. So you had, he had to be very responsible. Even we had Barbara Hill behind him to, to catch him if he did. But we could trust Cade. Okay. <laugh>. So if I would just say to, to Cade, are  
Speaker 3    01:27:22    You getting uncomfortable now? What? Are you getting uncomfortable now? No. I think, in other words, now to stop. This is why I left. Okay. So anyway, I've gotta tell you this. So, so I back to the Kingsley story. And, and when, and, and when I say if I ever do see him, I'll talk him about, about God, watch it kid <laugh>.  
Speaker 4    01:27:41    You might think it, you it from mom and dad. They're in charge of God. <laugh>.  
Speaker 3    01:27:47    But I said to Kingsley, I said, you befriended this child that had no friends. And I wanted, I said it slowly 'cause I wanted to hear it, her to hear it. And I said, and you were so important because she had a beautiful little voice. And she was so kind. We had to put her up on the top tier to be a pink angel. Because they were the sarafin, not the chair, but the Sarah. They were continually to cry. But she had a beautiful little voice. But Barbara Jean Hill during the program cut it off. Okay. I will in a minute. In a minute.  
Speaker 3    01:28:25    Because Cole could not be in the program. Oh. He could not sit still. He could not be God. He could not carry anything in. He could not do it. And his mother wanted him to be, and I wanted him to be, we wanted him to be a part of it. So Kingsley was at the top and Kingsley was the only friend he had in the school. So how to get Kingsley down, Barbara Jean Hill runs around. We let all the pink angels come in dead and sink. 'cause they had to carry the program. She went up to the top tier. 'cause we were all tiered. So we could see as much, as much as she could. But you never could see enough got Kingsley down after all the special parts. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Were to be done, scooted her around from the outside, went her back to the back row of the church where Cole was.  
Speaker 3    01:29:24    And she took his little hand, this 5-year-old. And Kingsley and Cole, she would walk with Kingsley and no one else except Mrs. Hill and mm-hmm <affirmative>. Walked up to the manger. And when they sang, what can I give him? I'll give him my heart. That last little bar, if you remember that. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Cole took his little heart down and put it in the manger. And it was so sweet. And I said, Kingsley always remembered that. I mean, here is old teachers still preaching. I know, sweetheart. And this is why I gave you and Lydia time to, I knew exactly what I needed to do. <laugh> <laugh>. I wasn't being rude. Well,  
Speaker 0    01:30:08    I really appreciate both of you giving me so much time today. It's been well, we  
Speaker 3    01:30:12    Had fun.  
Speaker 0    01:30:13    A pleasure to, we  
Speaker 3    01:30:14    Had fun to  
Speaker 0    01:30:15    Hear all your stories.  
Speaker 3    01:30:16    Remember your mind, Cole, I got cold. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:30:21    My mind, one of my cutest pictures that I have of Cade is, is, uh, I I, maybe he was a donkey and he had, well  
Speaker 3    01:30:28    We did have donkeys when he  
Speaker 0    01:30:29    Or a lamb I'll, I'll show you the picture sometime. It's so adorable. He's like looking back at me. But he's in this hat that, you know, that the animal hat? Uhhuh. <affirmative>. Oh, it's just adorable. Well, that,  
Speaker 3    01:30:39    That it was just a special time  
Speaker 0    01:30:40    Wasn't, it was great. It was  
Speaker 3    01:30:42    Special.  
Speaker 0    01:30:42    It was great. It was special.
