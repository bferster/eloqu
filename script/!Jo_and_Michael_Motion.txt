Title   Interviewed 6/10/22<br>by Lydia Strohl <>
Speaker 0    00:00:00    I am Lydia Stroll and I'm recording for the Middleburg Museum Project and I'm here with Joe and Michael Mo you.  
Speaker 1    00:00:10    My name is Joe Motion and she says, I've got to give you my age, which is 7 6 31 <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:00:19    And Michael,  
Speaker 2    00:00:21    I am Michael Motion. And your  
Speaker 1    00:00:26    Age  
Speaker 2    00:00:26    Is my age. I was born in 1930, so I am 92 in two weeks. One week meet.  
Speaker 0    00:00:39    And can you tell me a little bit about how you came to Middleburg, Joe? I know you came before you moved here, maybe you could start with  
Speaker 1    00:00:48    That. Yes. I came in the fifties, um, in the, when there's so much more steep chasing in Virginia. I used to come for the, for the Adams. It was duly Adams mother and father Duly was the then champion jockey. Very stylish, very good horseman. And I'd come to, what was Berlin in those days? Hickory Tree now. And owned by Eleanora, Sears. And I would bring about 15 horses and do all the hunt meets based in Middleburg here. So I got to know it quite well. Um, used to stay at the Red Fox, which was a, a, a place to stay, but I, I couldn't afford to eat in what was the New York Cafe in those days. Later the Coke stop and I'd take all my meals at the lunch counter in the pharmacy, which is now where the carpet guy is.  
Speaker 2    00:01:41    Loo  
Speaker 1    00:01:42    Loo. Yes. And uh, I used to take all my meals there. In fact, when I went home to get married in 56, um, the owner of the then pharmacy gave me a, um, recipe book signed and with a, with a plate in the front of it, which was really nice. And I've always kind of enjoyed it. Anyway, that's when I first came to this area and enjoyed it obviously, and realized that it was a, anyway, we, we were back in England for nearly 20 years. Raised the family there. We've got two American girls born in this country, and two English boys born in England. They were all educated in England except the boys. When we came back in 79, we came back with them and they finished at Kent in Connecticut. And um, so we were in Lexington, Kentucky in those days. 'cause Mike was a bloodstock agent for all those years. And, um, we came up because he was running a larger state up here over the, over the mountain. And then after several years his boss died, which kind of left us a little bit, not quite sure what, but anyway, we stayed, we, we chose to stay in Middleburg and um, and actually we were in Rectortown. We lived in Rectortown, but, um, but we chose to stay in Middleborough because it is a very nice place to live. We enjoy it.  
Speaker 0    00:03:23    When you first came, um, to the hunt meets, for those that don't know what that is, what time of year is it and what happens? Well,  
Speaker 1    00:03:32    That's spring. I would come up, we would winter down in the Carolinas, either Camden or Southern Pines. And, um, there was no, there was no racing in New York in those days. Everybody went south. Uh, but the steeper chasing there were, there was much more steeper chase racing in those days. It's, it was much more active. And, uh, you even had stigma chasing at Belmont Park for heaven, say. And, um, we would come up in the spring. There were all the hunt meets at Glenwood and at Strawberry Hill and at, oh Lord, I can't even remember the places, but, um, um, they, they still have basically all of them in the spring. And then of course they have some in the fall. But we would do the spring. I would come here with a bunch of horses. My boss and wife would go on to New York and I would stay in little burg and with a couple of fellas and about 15 horses. And, um, we'd get on them and guide them at, um, the Clark's track here on, on the edge of the farm here. Um, and I'd get on, I'd get on everything in the morning and the fellas would do the work. And, and it was nice. And I enjoyed living in Middleburg even then, which was way before we were married.  
Speaker 0    00:04:55    Where were you born?  
Speaker 1    00:04:56    In England? In, in, uh, born in, I think r would be probably the place most people would know. How do you spell? It's in Surrey's, halfway between London and the South Coast. Yeah. Gatwick. Yes. It's not that far from Gatwick.  
Speaker 0    00:05:11    How do you spell that?  
Speaker 1    00:05:12    Re R-E-I-G-A-T-E. Sorry.  
Speaker 0    00:05:18    And did you grow up there?  
Speaker 1    00:05:20    Yes, but that was during war, you see, I was, so when I was born in 31 war broke out in 39. And um, we were right under every bomber that went to London to drop bombs on London. We got really halfway blown out of our house. One window, all the windows were shattered and we had, uh, tar paper to the windows and top on the roof. But, um, you still went on dealing with it.  
Speaker 0    00:05:50    So, and, and, um, did you start to ride as a we  
Speaker 1    00:05:55    Child? The whole riding thing started, there's no background in my family except my grandmother who used to live ride in London in Rotten Row, which was the fashionable thing to do in her generation. And um,  
Speaker 2    00:06:11    That's in London. That's that's in London, yes. That's fancy pace to ride in London.  
Speaker 1    00:06:16    And, and I started, because before the war we always used to take a summer holiday down in a place called Wintering on the South coast. Lots of sand and very nice little thatch roof hotel and this and that. And I have lot, lot of memories about it. And they always had donkey rides on the beach at the weekends. And where I started, my whole horse career was on donkeys, on Wooding Beach. And I used to ride something home to the stable at night and stay and help think I was helping. Anyway, I wasn't very old, but, um, that's where the whole horse thing started, <laugh>, which is crazy. That  
Speaker 0    00:06:56    Is crazy. And then you were able to ride, was your, um, where you grew up, was  
Speaker 1    00:07:02    It, well then, then I had a rather, a mentor, a friend had had a hunter and a couple of phonies and she was very good to us kids. Was there were a couple of other kids, another family and myself. And, um, she would let us ride the ponies and we'd help her out in her to keep things right. And if she was away, we'd look after the, you know, it was, it was a sort of two-way deal. And, um, then, then I got into Fox hunting with her, um, because she was so generous with her time and her ponies and this and that. And, uh, that's how I got into the whole thing. And then that went to, we had a local steeplechase trainer who was pretty successful, Jack of Donahue. And by the time I was 14 I was riding out for him, you know, all summer and weekends and things when I could, as it was, I was cycling to school every day because I used to do it.  
Speaker 1    00:08:01    But about eight miles from home to my day school, my sisters were boarding school. But I couldn't deal with that. I actually ran away from boarding school in spite of sisters there and went to my grandmother. 'cause I knew she wouldn't send me back. So I went to a day school all the way through the war. And, um, there it was, but I was, the whole racing thing started with, with, uh, the steeplechase trainer and riding out for him. And, and that was where I was lucky enough to do this ma that came into the yard. 'cause you always did your three in England person who's doing, as they say, the horse, you, you ride, you groom, you muck out, you do everything for and take the races. And this rather, um, what shall I say, not exactly looking like a race horse came into the yard. She was bred, she was by a Guinness winner actually. Um, but um, she came into the yard because I was a new girl in the yard I got to do, to do nipple coin. And she wound up three years later winning the Grand National. So that was, I guess that was in.  
Speaker 2    00:09:15    And you got the photos to prove it.  
Speaker 1    00:09:16    I got the photos to prove it. Anyway.  
Speaker 0    00:09:21    Were there a lot of girls riding at that  
Speaker 1    00:09:23    Time? Very few. Very few. He actually had two or three, but there were no girls in this country. I was one of the first women galloping back stretch here in this country in the fifties at Belmont Park. There was us and Mickey Walsh was then another steeper chase trainer who was very successful in those days. And he had three daughters. So there were four of us at the track. Um, and that was very early days before women were allowed to carry a training license or anything. Wow. So it was, um, it was fun. We, my boss actually had a cottage on Belmont Park. I think it was owned by Liz Tippet. Yeah, Liz l Liz Whitney. Um, and uh, so I lived right on Belmont Park Racetrack for two or three years, which was, it was great.  
Speaker 0    00:10:15    And what was the, uh, what was Middleburg like when you  
Speaker 1    00:10:19    Used to come for the, for the, for the, well it was, you know, it's a long time ago, but I don't feel that it was particularly different from now there's a lot more traffic and this and that. Obviously there's a traffic light to start with. Um, but it was very, I don't know, people were always friendly and nice. I I was only here briefly in the spring and probably in the fall for a little while too. 'cause the steeper chase races, all the hunt meets around here were in the spring and the fall. And um, and then I'd go on down south. But, um, it, it, it was not dissimilar to, to now really. I mean I, there's nothing that I can pick on that was so different, but it is a long time ago. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. It's quite hard to think back quite so far.  
Speaker 1    00:11:12    But everybody was very friendly and nice. I didn't know the village at all in those days because you never had occasion to come into the village like we're in now, you know. But we're actually, Mike and I have both commented to each other that we're very happy that we've had a little bit of a wandering life. We've moved around quite a bit across the Atlantic, three times bag and baggage kids talks, bag and baggage. And um, we're very glad that we've wound up in Middleburg because we are very happy and settled here. And we are lucky enough to have family about three of the four kids relatively close. And, um, we have a lot of friends whose families are all over the world. And so we're very lucky. And it's, it's, it's a really nice place to live.  
Speaker 0    00:12:00    Were the, was were there a lot of, um, women riders when you came for the hunt meets  
Speaker 1    00:12:08    What? In in steeple chase?  
Speaker 0    00:12:09    Yeah, in the us  
Speaker 1    00:12:10    Oh, in, when I first came there was, there were no, I don't think there were any women at the professional level at the racetracks. Yeah. I don't think there were any women. I do truly believe that Mickey Walsh's daughters and myself were the first women galloping horses professionally at Belmont, for instance.  
Speaker 0    00:12:28    And the hunt meets then were all professional races like race,  
Speaker 1    00:12:33    The hunt meets are professional, point to points are point to points. Right. There is a distinction. They both run at Glenwood here they have the professional meat or the, I don't know, do they call it professional meat? It is basically professional, yes. But they  
Speaker 2    00:12:47    Also have a point to point run for the, by the steep or Chase association. Yes. There, where the point to the spring race, the point to points are lesser quality and are run by the hunts themselves. Right. There's a big difference between the distinction, the quality of the horse that's run, the quality of, of the racing and the horses.  
Speaker 1    00:13:04    But,  
Speaker 2    00:13:05    And the regulations and everything.  
Speaker 1    00:13:07    Those were the balmy days of, um, of steeper chasing. There was a lot of steeper chasing in those days. And uh, as I say, even at Belmont  
Speaker 2    00:13:16    And, uh, bit of a golden age.  
Speaker 1    00:13:18    Yes.  
Speaker 0    00:13:18    Right. Because now there's the spring races here and then Gold cup.  
Speaker 1    00:13:24    Yes. Much else in Virginia. No.  
Speaker 0    00:13:27    And it sounds to me like there were many, there were a lot more  
Speaker 1    00:13:30    In Strawberry Hill is down towards Richmond, if I remember rightly. And we, they had six races one day, one of them being a timber race. We never had timber horses. The bass didn't, well timber horses. And we took five horses and won five races. <laugh> not the timber. 'cause we didn't have a runner, but that was a big day.  
Speaker 0    00:13:52    Right. And did you grow up in the same area of Surrey?  
Speaker 2    00:13:56    Excuse me?  
Speaker 0    00:13:57    Did you grow up in the same area of Surrey  
Speaker 2    00:13:59    As Joe? Very much Surrey. Really? Because we went to the same kindergarten school,  
Speaker 1    00:14:05    <laugh>, I've known him all my life. Wow.  
Speaker 2    00:14:09    And, uh, she, she was not in my forms. They say in class, whatever you like to call it, grade. Um, but her older si one of her two older sisters were, she has two older sisters in England now. One's the same age as the Queen and the other's halfway between the two of them <laugh>. So we watch the royals with great interest. But, um,  
Speaker 1    00:14:36    Where  
Speaker 2    00:14:37    Monica's, her, her nearest elder sister was actually in my form. And I got to know the family through that at, at kindergarten, you know, and my family was lucky enough that, uh, we had a nice home with a part of, it was a great big old timber barn. And we, mum and dad used to ride, run a, uh, Christmas party for all our friends. So Joe's elder sister of the, of the three of of the two of them, uh, would be invited because we were in the form together and so on and so forth, and ate each other. And I didn't know it at the time, but when her father came to pick her up after the birthday parties and stuff, Joe would always be in the car. But she was supposed to be too young to come, come into the house. So there was only a a year of difference. I was too  
Speaker 1    00:15:38    Young to go to the party  
Speaker 2    00:15:39    <laugh>. But, you know, a a a year at that age makes a huge difference. Right. A a year at, uh, college age doesn't make any difference at all. So, but gradually we saw more and more of the family and got  
Speaker 1    00:15:55    We ny clubbed and fox hunted  
Speaker 2    00:15:56    Together. And then, um, I don't know if you fox hunted before the war, all, but we old enough, we lived in a little village and, um, part of my father's plan, thank God, was that we should be there with a little stable and somewhere to keep a pony and all this that and the other. And before long I was going fox hunting, which, you know, which great fun. And then wartime came and things got a bit different. But we still kept in families kept in touch. And, uh, after the war was over, we were both in the pony club together and she and I were both in the pony club together and, um, started messing, messing around, you know, with ponies and so on and so forth. Um, from the age of, well the, the war ended. We were 14.  
Speaker 1    00:17:02    I was 14,  
Speaker 2    00:17:03    You were 14. And the whole horse thing and the pony club gradually became central to our lives, you know, when we were at home and, um,  
Speaker 1    00:17:21    There was no gas in those days. We didn't have a trailer. We used to hack miles to the pony club meets, or the hunt meets. We'd packed, we'd hack miles. Honestly, nobody would dream of doing it in this day and age, but there was a lot less traffic on the road 'cause there was practically no gas available in England. But right after the wars, any people with special coupons, you know, professional people, doctors and things like that. So that must've been great fun. Then you  
Speaker 2    00:17:51    Spent the whole day, those were golden days Yes. With your mates were golden days  
Speaker 1    00:17:54    Riding and the war was over and everything was more relaxed. You know, it, it, it was, um, it was, it was huge <laugh> it was a very happy days.  
Speaker 2    00:18:06    But we, we were, we were close enough to go out with the same hunt and the same NY club and so on and so forth, except that Joe would have to ride usually the day before to the location of where the per club was going to be the next day. Well, sometimes because you couldn't possibly,  
Speaker 1    00:18:26    Sometimes I'd find myself at the end of the days hunting so far from home that I had, well, it was the master and his wife and son who, uh, I would stay the night there, put, put my pony in, installed at their place and stay the night. And they were always perfectly happy. And then we'd, we'd spend the evenings with a, um, a what's name map, you know, um, what's the detailed map? I can't think of the proper word. Um, and go over what we'd done hunting that day and, you know, over our boiled eggs. And it was fun. They were good days.  
Speaker 2    00:19:06    And, but when Joe was here in the early fifties, um, I graduated from, uh, agricultural school and I had great plans of being in England and farming in England was really all I wanted to do. But one thing led to another, and I was traveling in South America with cattle and doing all sorts of odd things that one does at that age. And I came home, um, to my mother's house near Gabert. And, um, Joe was on leave from her steeple chasing job in this country. And, um, suddenly we found ourselves back together in England. And that's when we got engaged.  
Speaker 1    00:20:15    We were married in 56. 56. So it's How many years did we work out the other day? 60 some. Anyway,  
Speaker 2    00:20:23    56, uh, what is 50, 65, is that right?  
Speaker 1    00:20:34    Somewhere around 65 years, isn't it?  
Speaker 2    00:20:36    It's 1956 from 2022. I I And,  
Speaker 1    00:20:42    And you were married? In  
Speaker 2    00:20:44    England? In England. England.  
Speaker 1    00:20:45    And  
Speaker 0    00:20:46    Did you come back here to work after that?  
Speaker 1    00:20:49    Oh, no, no. I, I, after we got engaged at very early spring, it was very early spring, um, my boss was Ill actually over here, and I promised him, I went home to get my papers, um, which Sears was a huge help towards. And, um, I had to come back that summer because my boss was ill. They were looking through, I had promised to come back and this and that. So I came back that summer. Then I went home in October to get married. And, um, and that was it. I mean, by then he was better and everything had sorted out. But I I, I couldn't quit at the time when I was still in England because I'd promised I'd come back to the sun. And, uh,  
Speaker 2    00:21:33    So, but all the time I would hear talking about Middleburg, Middleburg, Middleburg, what a lovely place it was and blah, blah. And so, uh, when she came back to England, that to get her papers straight and so on, it simply coincided with my going home to England and so on. And, um, one night I decided my mother had Joe to suffer and we were saying goodnight to each other. And I thought, this is crazy. I'm never gonna see this best friend again if I let her go now, <laugh>. So, uh, we got engaged that evening,  
Speaker 1    00:22:29    But I had to come back,  
Speaker 2    00:22:31    But she had to come back and she was happy. I surprised, happy to do it because she loved what she was doing. I guess  
Speaker 1    00:22:38    Probably it was not exactly on my mind, you know? But,  
Speaker 0    00:22:43    But you said yes.  
Speaker 1    00:22:45    Well, yes, because, you know, I had known him all my life. I mean, I <laugh> it was, um, quite an easy decision.  
Speaker 2    00:22:53    I, I thought, I thought this was crazy to say goodbye to this gal who was my best friend.  
Speaker 1    00:23:01    But anyway, then after  
Speaker 0    00:23:03    You were married, you stayed in  
Speaker 1    00:23:05    The uk We were actually up in New York. Mike was working for Faik Tipton, the Horse Auctioneers, you know.  
Speaker 0    00:23:12    So you came back to the US  
Speaker 1    00:23:14    Oh, yes. Well, we came back. We were married in October, and, um, we came back in the, uh, oh, 56. We came back in  
Speaker 2    00:23:24    The, uh, it was only about six months after, um, yes, after the wedding  
Speaker 1    00:23:29    Came because we found people were, Mike, Mike had been over here for a while, and people kept calling him from here to say, oh, you've got your December sales coming up, you've got this and that, and the other, find me a nice fo or find me this or this or that. Because they realized that he knew what was needed here. You see, he had had experience with the whole horse racing thing here. And now he was in England and, and could, that was in the days, well, it was in the early days of flying horses, wasn't it?  
Speaker 2    00:24:02    Very much so.  
Speaker 1    00:24:02    Very early. And, um, and that's how his whole bloodstock thing got started, really. But anyway, that's nothing to do with Milberg except when he came back here before we came back, I can't remember years are all battle. But he actually had an office above Ben and Mary's on, down towards Warrenton and, and spent his time in and around Middleburg. He, he rented a cottage, didn't you? Above Ben and Mary's then, or what was Ben and Mary's?  
Speaker 0    00:24:35    So you were in New York when you first came back, so you would find horses for people in England and bring them back.  
Speaker 2    00:24:42    Right, right.  
Speaker 2    00:24:45    Which moved to first place. It wasn't something that I set out to do because all I wanted to do was to be with animals and be at the farm, so on and so forth. And, um, when I realized that I couldn't do that in England, and Joe kept on about Middleburg, Virginia and Middleburg Middleburg, oh, I don't remember that. You did. You wouldn't remember because it was part, so much part of your life. And, um, so we decided, well, let's go to America and get a farm job in America. But that wasn't as easy as I thought. And, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:25:26    We worked in New York for Phasic for as about,  
Speaker 2    00:25:31    But eventually we found our way back here.  
Speaker 0    00:25:37    And your children were, when were they born?  
Speaker 1    00:25:40    Claire is the eldest, she's taught at Hill School for over 30 years. I think she's one of the longest tenured teachers at Hill. Um, Claire Nichols, she was born in 57, dein and Pippa number two, she's been selling Gome food in Washington, DC for years. Um, the Covid really hit her hard. Um, uh, Pippa Peppa, she was born in Pittsburgh. Pa Claire was born in, uh, Greenwich,  
Speaker 2    00:26:16    Connecticut. I couldn't get a farm job, um, in Virginia 'cause I didn't have the right knowledge, you know, Virginia license. We wound up in Pennsylvania, which was all right. And a nice lady. And that was, started  
Speaker 1    00:26:32    A stud farm there that within four years was selling, uh, lings at Saratoga.  
Speaker 0    00:26:39    Where was that?  
Speaker 2    00:26:41    Outside in the, in the hunt country. Outside Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh or Philadelphia. A case called Ley Pittsburgh.  
Speaker 1    00:26:49    Ley  
Speaker 2    00:26:50    Ley.  
Speaker 1    00:26:56    So I've got two American girls and two English boys. And both of boys were born in England when we went. Um, then you went back, we went back in, um, um, oh, I can't <laugh>. I would, I should have looked this up, but, um, we came back when, uh, I think Claire was six, I think. And, um, because he decided to, to get going here in a, in a funny way, in England, you're so often waiting for dead men's shoes, you know what I mean? Yeah. It's hard to strike out on your own in England, because  
Speaker 2    00:27:35    Particularly at that time when a lot of those middle management jobs and rural jobs were held by retired army officers. Yes. And they were all treated with great deference, you know, Colonel this and colonel there, and brigadier that the other,  
Speaker 1    00:27:55    So the poor graduate from San Ancestor Agricultural College didn't have a standard chance. But anyway, we came back here and that's when it got going like this. So you were, when were the other children born? Pippa was born in, Pippa was born in 59.  
Speaker 2    00:28:13    I've got the list of the, the dates. And Claire was born in, in the other room,  
Speaker 1    00:28:18    6 57, oh, wait a minute. Claire was born in 57. Graham was born in,  
Speaker 2    00:28:25    Let me get my book.  
Speaker 1    00:28:26    I've got it. No go. It's fine. Graham was born in 64, and Andrew was born in 66 in England. He's the trainer at in Fairhill. Now Grims, he's, again, it would not have been able to do in England what he's managed to accomplish here in the racing world, you know, because he's had a pretty fantastic career up to now. And, uh, you know, he's won of Darby and he's won of Dubai World Cup and a number of, uh, um, uh,  
Speaker 2    00:29:03    Grade one races. Yes. Grade  
Speaker 1    00:29:05    One races, breeders Cup races. And, um, but in England it's so different. You have to buy your own place. You have to have a lot of money behind you because you've got to buy your own case. You don't train at the racetrack In England here, as he said himself, you've just gotta have a bailor hay and a water bucket. And you can get started literally at the track renting them for $3 a day or what it used, whatever it used to be. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, now he's got his own barn at, uh, Fairhill. And I didn't mean to get on this. No, that's okay. And that's in Maryland? That's in Fairhill, Maryland, yes. Fairhill Training Center. A lovely place to train a horse.  
Speaker 0    00:29:45    So when you came back to the us, um,  
Speaker 1    00:29:49    The boys went to Canton, Connecticut, they weren't educated back,  
Speaker 0    00:29:52    But you came back to Middleburg at that point?  
Speaker 2    00:29:55    No, no. The journey to Middleburg has been quite fractured. Um, when we first start, start  
Speaker 1    00:30:01    New York, Kentucky, <laugh>,  
Speaker 2    00:30:06    A lot of our antique furniture looks very battered because it's been moved so many times. Many times. And I was talking to a chap who was an antique restorer, uh, what's Martin's name?  
Speaker 1    00:30:19    Robinson.  
Speaker 2    00:30:20    Robinson. Martin Robinson. Do you know Martin? I do, yeah. And he said to me, he said, Michael, he said, three moves and it's over. <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:30:29    Oh, it's not that bad.  
Speaker 2    00:30:30    I mean, no, he says in the trade, oh, you know, moving antiques more than three times is really, and we've made something like seven or eight moves at least, of which two or three were transatlantic.  
Speaker 1    00:30:48    But anyway, when we, when we got to Middleborough, we, or Rectortown is where actually we wound up and he was running and stayed over, over the mountain. And then we, um, getting into our old age, the family rather insisted that we move into a one story. And I didn't want to leave Rectortown at all. I enjoyed that house. It was a lovely house. We'd done so much to it.  
Speaker 0    00:31:11    A beautiful house.  
Speaker 1    00:31:13    And, um,  
Speaker 0    00:31:14    When did, what year  
Speaker 2    00:31:14    Did you go rent that? That was our, uh, basically our real home in America,  
Speaker 1    00:31:18    Because we were there over 30 years. But I had the shop for 30 years here in town too.  
Speaker 0    00:31:25    And, and what year did you move to the house in Rectortown?  
Speaker 1    00:31:30    <laugh>?  
Speaker 2    00:31:31    Listen, I can confirm some of these dates to you. That's fine. Over the telephone, that's  
Speaker 0    00:31:35    Fine. But 30 years is good enough.  
Speaker 2    00:31:38    Um, I've got, I have it all documented. We  
Speaker 1    00:31:41    Were in Rectortown for 30 years at least.  
Speaker 1    00:31:45    We had a house on Roee Road briefly, but it wasn't really our style house. It was rather a desperation move. And, um, I was, I was doing my good deed for the day. Graham had been in France and it was, uh, at a, with a trainer in, uh, Chantilly, learning his trade. And, um, I was driving to get his driving license for him because he needed to run out when he was gone in front. And, uh, I drove through Rectortown and here was the sign up for sale of the, the house there as it was in those days, which needed a lot of work. But it was, it, it was a lovely spot. And, uh, so that's, it was during my God deed driving through to go to Warrington to get his driving license that, uh, I spotted the house.  
Speaker 2    00:32:36    I was in Kentucky or somewhere.  
Speaker 1    00:32:38    Yes, you were away. You were always away over the moves. He was always on an airplane somewhere else in the world. <laugh>, a lot of traveling in those days. So a, a  
Speaker 2    00:32:50    Blood, I was in Kentucky and I got, 'cause nobody had cell phones and stuff.  
Speaker 1    00:32:56    No,  
Speaker 2    00:32:56    That's, and I got this telephone call and Joe said, I found it. I said, what do you mean you found it? I found the house. We want, I found the house we want, what shall I do? I said, go to the bank, draw out a check and put it down. And by the time I came back, she'd secured the <laugh>, the, what do you call it? The option or whatever  
Speaker 1    00:33:23    Contract.  
Speaker 2    00:33:24    I, I knew that her, that her taste was exactly my taste. So it wasn't hard to make a decision.  
Speaker 1    00:33:36    What was Rectortown like when you moved there?  
Speaker 2    00:33:40    Quiet.  
Speaker 1    00:33:41    Yes. It'd been a, the family was, was a brother and two sisters lived together. The Ashby's lived together in Rectortown. And um, he'd been minister, hadn't he, up at the Methodist Church? I think so. But anyway, they'd lived there quietly. And, and the house, basically the front of the house was a two room log cabin, which turned, turned into one big sitting room. We actually uncovered some of the log when we got there in the sitting room, but it was so primitive that we covered it up again. But we did dig out the old fireplace and, um, the front door went in up steps off the road, which of course was impossible as it is now, right. As it was then 30, 40 years ago. Um, so, um, uh, we, we took the front door out and moved that put, put the, the, the kind of the, uh, the porch.  
Speaker 1    00:34:40    Porch, yeah. On the front. It was, when we got there, it was what they called the sun gun. No, when it, when we took it down, there were no footings. I mean, it was just down on the ground. This, this sunroom they called it. But we put the porch and put the front door there. And where the bay window is, is where the front door was. But it was a, it is a lovely house and it was a lovely sitting room there. Very, um, I don't know. But then it got, so the traffic got so bad. It's much quieter here in Middleburg, Virginia. Honestly,  
Speaker 2    00:35:13    You'd be amazed how quiet this street is. I mean, the  
Speaker 1    00:35:17    North south roads get busy here, but the east, west roads, there's no traffic for just residents. And there's only two, three front doors on this road. Only two of them affect us, ours and theirs right across the street. And the rest is that field there. So it's so quiet. You, you cannot believe how much quieter it is than <inaudible>.  
Speaker 2    00:35:39    The, there's a sweet little girl who comes and I dunno, she visits her grandmother or whatever. No, she lives on the corner of Oh, what age group? She would be,  
Speaker 1    00:35:49    So she's at Bica High School,  
Speaker 2    00:35:51    So, but, um, oh, elementary.  
Speaker 1    00:35:53    She's at Banneker Elementary.  
Speaker 2    00:35:54    Oh, Ben. But, um, not long after we were here, after we arrived, I was going for a walk and here's this little kid all on her own in the middle of the crossroads. I mean, four roads. And she was building, sitting on the ground, building a little castle with twigs and leaves and this, that, and absolutely absorbed, I mean, no, no attention to anything. And not a car within sight, you know, just or anybody else. Or anybody else. And she is a sweet little thing. Do you know our daughter-in-law? Um,  
Speaker 1    00:36:40    Janie.  
Speaker 2    00:36:41    Janie, Janie Covington.  
Speaker 0    00:36:42    I do,  
Speaker 2    00:36:43    Yes. Yeah. Well, you, you, she's married to Andrew Right. Our second son. And, um, Janie has his house next door as a, as a rental property. And, uh, she'd come in there and be doing some gardening and stuff, and this little kid would wander over and settle along with Janie and chat and watch her gardening and so on, you know.  
Speaker 1    00:37:13    But what he's getting at is, there's so little traffic.  
Speaker 2    00:37:16    There's so little traffic.  
Speaker 1    00:37:17    It's perfectly safe for her. She's taken to bicycling now  
Speaker 2    00:37:22    On Oh yeah, she's big time now. She's got a little scooter and  
Speaker 1    00:37:26    It's, it's perfectly safe because nobody comes in here a great brush and chair anyway. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:37:32    We, we moved to Rectortown when my son was two, and so he has friends the same age on the road. We could never let them bike to each other's house or walk.  
Speaker 2    00:37:44    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:37:44    Or even walk.  
Speaker 1    00:37:45    They  
Speaker 2    00:37:46    Flies you right to time. Oh, God's a forbid. Walking. Do you remember used to, we  
Speaker 1    00:37:50    Had that sign, had that speed sign.  
Speaker 0    00:37:53    There's another one right now. Oh, is it? Someone's put it, someone's put up the blinking sign again. It's not the same one. It's, it's much neater. It has smaller, like just the one you put right on the speed, speed sign.  
Speaker 2    00:38:07    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:38:07    I don't think it makes much difference at all.  
Speaker 2    00:38:10    We found it made absolutely no difference,  
Speaker 1    00:38:12    Basically. Um, I mean, I think they'd slow down to think about it.  
Speaker 2    00:38:16    And they, and that sign actually belonged to the, um, uh, held a trumbo.  
Speaker 0    00:38:23    Yeah. It was in our barn for a while.  
Speaker 2    00:38:25    That's right. That's right. It was your barn. That's right. But we paid for the electricity and all that.  
Speaker 1    00:38:33    Well, we were happy to do that. But anyway.  
Speaker 0    00:38:37    Well, I think the, the fell across the street from you has taken up the torch on the, yeah, on the  
Speaker 1    00:38:43    Speeding in the house across from us. Cassie, what's name's house?  
Speaker 0    00:38:48    Uh, and the house on the corner. The George Washington house? Yes. Oh, down from us? No, no. Behind. Opposite. No, behind that. The one, the house with the pond. Right. Uh, Matt. Matt, somebody. That's it.  
Speaker 1    00:39:04    Oh, oh. In the, in the, um, the old, uh, waste and ordinary.  
Speaker 0    00:39:08    Yes, yes,  
Speaker 1    00:39:10    Yes. We were there when those kids were drowned in that pond. It was ridiculously really. Well, yes, but we didn't know it was going on. Actually. I wasn't actually there. I'd slipped into Marshall, but I'd seen them and I chatted with the fella for some reason around  
Speaker 0    00:39:26    What actually happened.  
Speaker 1    00:39:28    Well, I don't think they realized. I think it was a very hot day. And there were three kids with this babysitter fella. He was quite responsible. My god knows how you fell. Um, but I don't think they realized that there's no walking into the pond in back there. It drops straight down into that deep soft mud. So there's no footing. You know, it's all soft mud in those ponds. The pond in back of us, Molly Morgan and Lars, that was only a little bitty thing before Molly Morgan took up. The  
Speaker 1    00:40:03    Doing up those fields behind us, our think our house was the house for that area. And then Molly bought the, before we were there, the, the old school house. And she owned the land behind us, um, and has ever since tried to buy the piece of land for the, the, the old wood between which nobody can figure out who it belongs to. Huh. Um, so they haven't sold it fortunately, because I'm very much afraid. She tidy it up. And it's wonderful being left as it is. The bird life there is phenomenal. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. With the water and the, the old trees, you know, there's ated woodpecker in there to start with a pair of them. We used to see them quite often. But the, the birds in recti time are phenomenal. I have to say. Pete, moving into Middleburg, as I said earlier, the, the dawn chorus here in Middleburg wakes me up when we've got, when I've got the window open, which is often, it's absolutely astonishing. They sit in these trees here and sing away. You, you've never heard anything like it.  
Speaker 0    00:41:15    When, just to wrap up the story about the pond.  
Speaker 1    00:41:19    Oh, well, I think that they went to paddle and I think they all immediately got in trouble because they'd sort of think that they were walking off the edge and there was, there was no walking.  
Speaker 0    00:41:30    And they were small kids.  
Speaker 1    00:41:32    And they were, they were not old kids at all. They were in the,  
Speaker 2    00:41:35    Um, they weren't, they were pre-teens. They,  
Speaker 1    00:41:38    Oh, we pre-teens, yes. Probably, I don't know, eights, tens, I  
Speaker 2    00:41:43    Don't know. But the story that we got in the end from the Sheriff's department, I guess, or whatever, that this little group, I, four or five of them,  
Speaker 1    00:41:55    There were three or four, I think.  
Speaker 2    00:41:57    I, I think they must have been from one of the schools to go up the hill or something. I think they, and with this fellow who was  
Speaker 1    00:42:06    Taking them on their  
Speaker 2    00:42:07    Bicycle, taking them on the back cruise, that's how they got there, bicycle ride. And so, and they got hot and the place was not occupied at the time. And, um, they just stopped, decided and decided to have a swim.  
Speaker 1    00:42:23    Well, not a swim, but I don't  
Speaker 2    00:42:25    Swim well to cool down they went. Then it became a chain of disasters because once the first child got stuck, another one went in to try and help him out. And then the, the leader went to try and help him get him out. I think he's, and the one boy, there was one boy who took it into his head to run up, tell somebody to notify somebody. But the only person he knew was his grandmother in, at the store at the top of the door. Oh. Further than that, it was in Marshall. So he got on his bicycle, you know, no cell phones or anything like that. And cycled all the way back to Marshall to alert the grandmother who alerted the rescue squad. And by that time, half of them had drowned. And we came home from wherever we were, I think,  
Speaker 1    00:43:21    I think all the young kids,  
Speaker 2    00:43:22    Three hours. We came home from wherever we were, knowing nothing about this right outside our back door to find these, uh, police tapes all over the place. You know,  
Speaker 1    00:43:34    I had gone out as they arrived, so I didn't see it happen. But I had been, I'd seen them there at the pond. Didn't think that they would, you know, I mean, kick myself for not, you know, being there a little longer. 'cause I would've said, oh, I wouldn't go in there. 'cause I knew that it went down on the edge because I, I've gotten  
Speaker 2    00:43:55    Tackles and things. But that child, but that child didn't, didn't know anybody in the village to go and ask them to telephone or  
Speaker 0    00:44:01    Was there, was it there a wall around it  
Speaker 2    00:44:04    Then? No, no.  
Speaker 0    00:44:05    That happened after No  
Speaker 1    00:44:07    Wall. Around  
Speaker 0    00:44:07    Where, because there's a wall around the property  
Speaker 1    00:44:09    Now. Oh, is it? Oh, just, I think I saw it. It's very new. Very new. Well,  
Speaker 0    00:44:14    The stone wall was there and then they put a, they put  
Speaker 1    00:44:17    A, well, the stone. Yeah. And they  
Speaker 0    00:44:20    Put a wood fence on  
Speaker 1    00:44:20    Top. Yes. No, that the wood fence is showing you. No, there was nothing around it.  
Speaker 0    00:44:26    So they could just  
Speaker 1    00:44:27    Walk. Yeah. And there was nobody in the house. It was empty. It was a sign outside. Right. The house has changed hands a number of times since we were, when we were,  
Speaker 2    00:44:37    They rent. It's a very inconvenient little house. It, it, you know, historically it's, it's super And, but it's not the architecture and that, but it's all little cubby holes with single, single plank walls  
Speaker 1    00:44:52    And, and up the stairs. The stairs were about yay wide and very low. He would've had to have been going up the, you know,  
Speaker 2    00:44:58    We looked at it seriously. Yes. 'cause  
Speaker 1    00:45:00    It was on  
Speaker 2    00:45:00    The market, but it was charming and it, it would've been good for a museum, you know. But it's very, very, very inconvenient for living. It really is.  
Speaker 0    00:45:12    Yeah. I went in at first when Helen had it for sale, and then  
Speaker 1    00:45:18    I When was that?  
Speaker 0    00:45:20    That was maybe 15, 10, 15 years ago. Yeah. And then I've been in it since Matt and Amy have been there, and they've been doing some work to it.  
Speaker 1    00:45:29    I, I don't know this Mattie,  
Speaker 0    00:45:31    It's charming. They moved in maybe right as  
Speaker 1    00:45:36    You left. As we left, probably, yeah. 'cause I didn't, I didn't know.  
Speaker 2    00:45:40    He, he came about six or eight months before we moved because I had several conversations with him about things and Oh, you did? And then they, they were on about the, uh, television or whatever, the fiber.  
Speaker 1    00:45:57    Hmm, the fiber. The fiber.  
Speaker 2    00:45:58    Yeah, the fiber, yes.  
Speaker 1    00:45:59    That's happened right after we,  
Speaker 2    00:46:02    They asked me, you know, whether we wanted it to hook it up. And I said, no, we're about to move. There's no point. So I said, well make it so that somebody make the junction box or whatever it is. So in  
Speaker 1    00:46:18    Fact, we  
Speaker 2    00:46:19    Did that and, but just don't lay it onto the house. So we told them to do that.  
Speaker 0    00:46:25    Right. Tell me about starting your shop.  
Speaker 1    00:46:31    Starting my shop.  
Speaker 2    00:46:32    Nancy Lee. I was 60.  
Speaker 1    00:46:34    Yes. Uh, the first person, the first, the first person I ever met in this village was Nancy Lee Pumpkin's mother. Did you know her? You didn't know her. Has she been gone?  
Speaker 2    00:46:46    She's been gone a year or two. Didn't,  
Speaker 1    00:46:49    Anyway, lovely, lovely person. Mrs. Middleburg really is what I always used to call her. And, um, she, she was just so nice. She would do the books for Liz Tippet as she was then, Liz Lun, Whitney, whatever you want to call her. And in those days, and we actually had MAs on the stud farm that we had in New Market for Liz Tippet. And the only time, and I shouldn't say this, you've got this radio going up, I think I better leave that alone. But anyway, Nancy, I went to Nancy to say I'm going to stop. I used to dress my kids in writing things from a similar shop, which I like to think mine was cleaner and tidier. But in those days, so I had the whole background in my head, you know, of what I was trying to achieve. And, um, and I went to Nancy.  
Speaker 2    00:47:45    You got the idea from the place in England.  
Speaker 1    00:47:48    Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I used  
Speaker 2    00:47:50    To dress the kids in England. Yeah. Must make it clear that that was in,  
Speaker 1    00:47:52    In England. Oh, this was in England, yes. When, uh, when we went back there. And, uh, anyway, sand and saddle it was called. But anyway, I went to Nancy knowing that she'd know if there was any suitable place in middleware coming up to rent. And she did, which was the end unit on there. And that was perfect. I didn't want to be on Main Street. I wanted to be back where there was some parking, legal or illegal. Um, and, uh, she, she said, oh, so it never, that actually never came on the market. I'd snaffled it before through Nancy Lee and been there ever since. And that was, I was 60 when, when that happened. And it just grew like topsy. It was crazy. I mean it in no time at all. When I gave it up recently, I, I gave it to, um, Geraldine Peace, whom, whose family we've known in England for years.  
Speaker 1    00:48:50    Her father used a pony club with us <laugh> in England. And they went to Canada. He was a very, very good veterinary surgeon. And he went to Guelph there, veterinary college in Canada to teach. He, so the family went to Canada and Geraldine had been down here for some years. And so I, that's why I passed it on to her. I didn't want to sell it because I figured that I'd have no say in what went on afterwards. And I don't, I keep my 2 cents out now, but at least I assured her that I would like it to continue. It's been a successful shop, you know, I mean the, the, the, the makeup has worked. And so I was anxious that it should stay. 'cause I've had a lot of really nice letters from people about how much they've enjoyed it and how, what a service it was doing basically to a lot of people.  
Speaker 1    00:49:47    'cause all this hunting stuff has gotten very expensive. And we used to get some real quality stuff in it. May have got some years, but the quality, you know, I still have jackets that I bought, you know, 20 years ago. Yeah. Well, and um, we used to sell over 500 saddles a year, you know, in the end. But anyway, through Nancy, I got that end unit and set up with Laurie Westman. Do you know Laurie Westman? No, she's a, she's Marshall and lovely person. She did the book, she set it up, the two of us set it up. Um, I always owned it, you know, but she came and set it up and then worked for me for close to 30 years after that. Um, but, uh, eventually I managed to get downstairs next door and then upstairs. So, so I've got, they've got the two units now and we drill through the thing. So it's, it's a wonderful space. Perfect. Because you need quite a bit of space for dealing with consignments coming in and things. So it does take quite a bit of space. And, um, it was just what I wanted to do. Mike's boss had died, so he was basically then out of a job. And having educated four kids, there was no way that we were gonna sit back and retire at that age. So, so, um, so I started the shop.  
Speaker 0    00:51:15    And you had come back to the Middleburg area when you got the job for the  
Speaker 1    00:51:19    Yes, we came from Kentucky.  
Speaker 0    00:51:23    So, so coming. Yes. So the, the shop in Rectortown kind of coincided?  
Speaker 1    00:51:28    Oh, no, no, no, no. Well, I guess in a way, yes, we were at Rectortown when I had we, what, what are you saying? I started the shop in 92.  
Speaker 0    00:51:40    92.  
Speaker 1    00:51:42    I'm pretty sure it was 92. And we'd gone to Rectortown, oh shoot, I can't remember  
Speaker 0    00:51:50    <laugh>. But you had already been in Rectortown for some  
Speaker 1    00:51:52    Years. We'd been in Rectortown for a little while and, um, and it was through Nancy Lee that I found the thing and, and just got going. And the whole thing just took off, you know, it was remarkable. And Laurie was a huge help 'cause she set up all the books and this, and when, when I took myself out of it recently, we had over 14,000 consignors. And they grow every day. You know? Now I can't say that all of them are still living from square one, but, but uh, we had 14,000 on the books.  
Speaker 0    00:52:30    That's amazing. What kind of thing, tell me like, is there any story of an amazing thing you've got or? I mean,  
Speaker 1    00:52:43    I don't really know. We used to take, you know, the old custom made coats used to have names in and dates and things. And we, we got a really nice real melting coat. 'cause people call Mel things that are just wool coats. They're not melting at all. I don't think most people know what Melton cloth looks like. But it, we got a really nice lady's melting coat in  
Speaker 1    00:53:07    The black coat with I think silver, um, hunt buttons on of a defunct hunt. So they were still on because the hunt was outta business. And um, it had a name and it was Rockefeller inside and a date of 28 or something, I can't remember. I've got a photo of it somewhere. 'cause I took a photo of the right and uh, somebody came in absolutely fell for it. Never, it never went hunting again. It was used as a, as a dress code in DC 'cause it was beautifully made, beautifully tailored. And with the, the funk button, she could wear them. And it was, and that was a crazy thing. You know, she, she bought it to wear it with pants or whatever, you know. But I don't know that we had, um, we had some fairly extraordinary things, but nothing that jumps to mind that was that out of the ordinary.  
Speaker 1    00:54:06    I don't know. You know, people would bring us some things and I'd have to turn some, I I wanted to keep it a tap shop, not a consignment junk shop. You know, and this is a little bit, but I not say that. Um, I'm very conscious of these things. Um, it's hard to turn down you to turn people away with China and this and that and the other. You, you do not want to turn into Justin everything to do because it had a horse on it. It was in there, you know, I tried to keep up the quality. You've got to keep up the quality.  
Speaker 0    00:54:46    Well, and you had a mission. Your mission was useful.  
Speaker 1    00:54:50    Yes, yes. Functional. Functional, yes.  
Speaker 2    00:54:53    Absolutely.  
Speaker 1    00:54:53    But it, and it also, you've got to keep up the quality and not, and, and get tough about turning things down. And, and if you, if you take, and of course we never had Western stuff. A I don't know anything about it because I've never ridden Western in my life. And, and the difficulty was people would bring in just a Western run. Oh, well it'll sell. Yes. But if you take one, the next person comes in and says, oh, I'm just giving up riding. I I I'm going to bring my Western stuff in. No, I don't want the western stuff. You've got to be tough about it. You, you, it's really quite difficult to, but anyway. And there's two girls still in there now. Both of them have been with me close to 20 years. So,  
Speaker 0    00:55:42    And Claire worked in there at  
Speaker 1    00:55:43    The weekends. Claire does the weekends. Yes. That's another story that I'm <laugh>  
Speaker 2    00:55:49    Claire is now twice over a grandmother.  
Speaker 1    00:55:55    We have great grandparents. Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:55:58    That occupies quite a lot of her time. Those  
Speaker 0    00:56:00    Are very cute children. <laugh>,  
Speaker 1    00:56:03    You've met the boys. Have you?  
Speaker 0    00:56:04    Yeah. And Oh, you have? I was, um, my, when the, when my goddaughter was getting confirmed, one of them was getting baptized. Oh. So I remember.  
Speaker 1    00:56:17    Oh, which kids? Claire's kids. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Oh, I thought you were talking about Caroline's two boys.  
Speaker 0    00:56:21    Yeah, no, one of Caroline's, one of Caroline's boys was getting, I think the first one was getting,  
Speaker 1    00:56:28    I don't think it's been baptized. Has he? Anyway, it doesn't matter. Um, anyway, she's got baby, he's three months. Did we? Yes. I don't remember. Um, anyway, she's got another one now. He's three months. Big chap. You know, Ben, have you met Ben? Her husband? He's six foot eight, you know, lovely fella. Such a nice guy. Caroline's got very happy family there.  
Speaker 0    00:56:56    Where do they live  
Speaker 1    00:56:58    In, uh, Alexandria.  
Speaker 0    00:57:00    So also close. It's so  
Speaker 1    00:57:01    Lucky. Yes. Caroline just come off maternity leave. She's just gone back to work. She's got a very good job. So I'm not sure Ben is in banking.  
Speaker 0    00:57:11    Um, and where's Josh now?  
Speaker 1    00:57:13    Josh, it works for Deloitte and spends a great deal of time in the Pentagon, apparently. And we don't know what he does 'cause we're not allowed to know what he does. He's just been on a trip to Hawaii at some conference or other that Deloitte sent him to. So I don't know. He's doing fine. Meredith has got a, she's um, HR and she won the HR of the Year award in DC so she's got a good job. So they've done well. And you know, Claire, you've gotta give her, she educated those kids. I mean she worked herself silly. She's always had two jobs, the school and the shop because she basically had to, she and I think they've got all the loans paid off <inaudible>. But, um, did you did a hell of a job raising those kids. Yeah. Against all odds.  
Speaker 0    00:58:08    Josh was very good friends with my steps. Oh, Christopher. And in it is, he's a year older and that's why he went to Swee. My stepson went to Swee.  
Speaker 1    00:58:20    Oh, is that 'cause it suited Josh wonderfully. I was surprised that he got in, to be  
Speaker 0    00:58:25    Honest. Well he, my stepson also played lacrosse and he was all set to go to another school. And in the spring when lacrosse started, Josh talked Christopher up to the Suwanee. And I'll never forget that the fellow called him and, and said, I've heard about you and I spoke with your coach. Would you be interested in coming to Suwanee? And he dropped his plans and was very happy.  
Speaker 1    00:58:51    Josh. I don't know that it was lacrosse that got Josh in necessarily, but apparently now this is what I learned from Claire. He wrote some essay or other  
Speaker 1    00:59:06    For, for getting, which was path, the course for getting in the school, I gather. And apparently the fellow who received and read the essay said that it was about the best essay he'd ever had. He kept it as an example from then on the students there at the school. Apparently Josh is is got extraordinary writing ability. You know, you kind of wouldn't guess it really. But anyway, I think it was that, that got him in more than the lacrosse. But he, Swanee was good for him. It was a perfect for him. I don't know how your stepson did, but  
Speaker 2    00:59:46    I think there's a lot of luck involved when these kids go to college. Because if they don't find the right tutor or professor, however you call it, that clicks with them.  
Speaker 1    01:00:01    It can be a successor.  
Speaker 2    01:00:03    They can, they can waste the whole time. But if they can really find somebody, and and Josh will admit it, that you find, I mean, what was he about halfway through the college when he clicked with this guy and all of a sudden life took off for him. And he, he's become a very, very interesting chap. Um, he works much too hard. He looks like a ghost  
Speaker 1    01:00:28    Josh now. He really  
Speaker 2    01:00:29    Does. But, um, he looks exhausting. He, he's, he's on the fast track with Deloittes, whatever it is he does.  
Speaker 1    01:00:38    And do you have a granddaughter that's in, followed your footsteps in racing as well? Oh, Andrew's youngest. Mary, you met Mary. I have, yeah. You know, little bit Mary, well Mary now just bought a little house in Lexington, Kentucky. 'cause she's determined that's where she belongs. 'cause she enjoys this whole thoroughbred industry. And I think I made a comment. She's doing what I used to do for Mike. She's now got a job with a bloodstock agent who's really successful. And she, he gives her a list of horses and she, this is part of the job. And she goes through sorting out the ones he should go to the back and look at and, and the ones to forget because they're just not up to it. And also she's got, they've got a website going, what do they call it? Farm manager or something,  
Speaker 2    01:01:30    Something like that.  
Speaker 1    01:01:31    And she's, because she, Mary was very smart. She's been in the thorough world here and Australia. She went to New Zealand, she went to England. So she's got experience of this. And this is what this website that they're trying to get going. Um, don't ask me what it does because I don't know. And, and they're setting it up and I'm not sure they all know.  
Speaker 2    01:01:55    Well it's an informational platform for anything to do with racing really very in a, in a word but on a worldwide scale. They're already operative in England, France, and Australia, Mary. And they've been looking for the right person to set it up in America. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:02:15    Yes. And, and they seem to fasten  
Speaker 2    01:02:16    On, fortunately they picked  
Speaker 1    01:02:18    On Mary, Mary has a very good eye for a horse. You know, you've either got it or you haven't going round, yelling sales or full sales or whatever, you know, weaning or whatever. Um, but she's definitely got an eye for a horse. 'cause this fellow seems and a feel for them. Yes, yes. That's, oh, Mary's a very good rider. The trouble is, and then she gets always put on the rottenness horse sort of thing. She was, she was riding, working in England for a trainer over there and they had a horse. And Mary was the only person who got out on Lambourne dance with this thing in a, um, come on, what do I need? Camon? No, not Camon. It's now for No, the LER thing. Come on. This is what I do all the time now. Hackamore, that's thought she called. She's the only person, the canvas, no hackamore.  
Speaker 1    01:03:14    She the only person who would take this horse out on the piece in a hackamore when you've got no bit in his mouth, you know? And she's had some little bit of a rockfall. She already had her back 'cause she keeps getting put on the difficult ones, the temperamental ones, because she's got a great affinity with the horse. She got that from Patty. Did you know Patty? A little bit? Yeah, a little bit. Patty was a very good horse. Could get in outside the heads. Mary can get inside a horse's head, you know, and so we're full of hope that this job will work out. She's already busy with it at the sales and things. You know, she's bought a little house in Lexington in Midway, actually just outside Lexington. And uh, so she's away And Lilette is here. Li Bit's here. She's now taken over one of the bigger barns in <inaudible>.  
Speaker 1    01:04:02    At At the Vogels? Yeah. At the Vos. Yeah. And, um, I just heard that and she's very thrilled and is wonderful turn. Of course all she's, she's full house. She moved from a smaller barn 'cause she needed more stalls and they have her there and it was great trail riding and it's great riding inside there. 'cause you can imagine how thrilled her customers are. She's got a couple of older ladies, I think. And, you know, and it's wonderful. And she gets on with the verbals and the vocals appear to be very happy to have her. They're, they're very nice. They're, they're very nice generous. Claire knows. Yes, Claire knows. Yeah. And, uh, so it's all seems to be working out beautifully. And Li Bit works like that. They can, but then all those kids are hard workers. Did you ride after your children were born?  
Speaker 1    01:04:52    No, basically not. I, I quit. I kind of quit when we were married. Really. It's a full-time job if you're going to be doing anything with horses, you know? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And particularly with racing, we follow racing like that. We've got racetrack network on the television. You know, that's what that dish is over there. <laugh> as ugly as it is and we hate having it. But we get, uh, so we can follow what Graham's doing and, you know, we can get any racetrack in the country on it. He's going to, um, ask it on Saturday night. He's gotta run a very good feeling that he's got, hopefully. 'cause you know, you get over there and the going is always so different they race ongoing that you never see in this country. The, the, the mud, you know, here, they're basically running on firm surfaces that half the British trainers wouldn't run on.  
Speaker 1    01:05:44    'cause it's, they think it's too hard. Whenever they come over for these turf races, the English, the first thing they do is look at the going say, oh, that's so hard. I'm not sure I want to run my Philly or this or that. They don't run on them. So they, they're run in hot deep mud, which American horses get stuck in. You know, I dread it because ask it, there's one place in the course there that swimming bottom. It's can get quite wet down there. And American horses aren't used to going like that. That's what caught him out with, uh, what's his name? Animal Kingdom, wasn't it? Yeah. The going. But, uh, that was a lovely horse. That was such  
Speaker 2    01:06:28    A, well an animal kingdom at was in trouble with fillies around him.  
Speaker 1    01:06:35    Well, he suddenly turned, he came home from Dubai to England to run in the, to run at Ascot. All of a sudden he turned into a stallion. I think the traveling had done it, you know, all of a sudden he realized the fillies were about. So that also did not help, but Aspen, he, he changed the kind of character. He became a stallion. Well, you know, he sort of woke up to the fact that that was his job. Right. <laugh>. And it was early days. It was his job. But anyway, but, um, Graham had a lot of fun with him. It was good. But we watch all his races and things now. Well,  
Speaker 0    01:07:17    You must have had quite an eye for horses. You must have had quite an eye, must have quite an eye for horses to have such  
Speaker 2    01:07:23    A career. Well, I dunno about that. Joe's got a very good eye.  
Speaker 1    01:07:27    Well, I, no, I know. True. I used to go ahead. Which is a lot of what Mary does now and cut out the crap that he doesn't need to go back and look to, he looks at the pedigrees, picks 'em out of the catalog. And you, I mean, Mary said she had a hundred horses to look out at the house sale, but he, she'll cut out half of those for him not to bother to go look. You see? So you've saved time. And that's what I used to do for him. It's very easy to cut out the crab <laugh>.  
Speaker 2    01:07:53    The, I would never make a horse show judge, because as Joe says, the ones that don't count, you can tell that they're, they're ordinary, you know? But when you get two or three top horses that you're comparing to each other, that gets pretty tricky. But's sparking the characters an origin. A lot of what has made the difference at the thoroughbred sales these days. I mean, I, I started when, well, it was  
Speaker 1    01:08:33    A new form of  
Speaker 2    01:08:34    Selling. Um, I, I mean, you could make the world stop and look at you when you paid a hundred thousand guineas for a horse, which is about $150,000 now. People have so much money. So there's a huge amount of cash all over the world. Not just here, but all over the world particularly. Yeah. The people don't know what to invest in. And you get people like this, uh, e what's his name with the rockets? Uh, Egan,  
Speaker 1    01:09:12    Oh, um,  
Speaker 2    01:09:13    Whatever his name is.  
Speaker 1    01:09:14    I, I can't remember his name.  
Speaker 2    01:09:15    I can't see.  
Speaker 1    01:09:16    Eli Musk. Eli Musk. There  
Speaker 2    01:09:18    Were Musk. There you are. You know, he doesn't know what to do with his money. So he is trying to go and m up the stratosphere, <laugh>, we haven't finished mucking up this place yet. And the, he, he and, uh, the English fella, they're all racing to go and muck up the stratosphere, you know,  
Speaker 1    01:09:40    But it's, it's  
Speaker 2    01:09:41    A, but there's so much money. So today you can go to the sales and you can find mil horses costing a million dollars that nobody's ever been on the back of them. You know, they dunno what they're like, but they look right. They've come from the right pry. And so if you get two or three people like that, um, you suddenly find that, you know, a million dollars doesn't really get you a whole lot unless you're dead lucky. So what you have to have is an eye. You have to look at all the horses and have an eye for those that you think look the right type. At  
Speaker 1    01:10:31    Least have the athletic ability.  
Speaker 2    01:10:33    And, um, it can happen. It can happen. But it keeps everybody guessing. And I mean, the sales this year were, well, last year, even with the covid and everything, ab absolutely wild because it's now a world market. At one time, the world market was in England because all the, uh, <affirmative>, uh, related countries, the dominions and the colonies and this, that and the other. And every, everybody who went abroad from England, they were still riding horses and so on. And they got, we have a relative who is a mad cricketer. And there's a system on, on the internet now of keeping all the statistics for cricket all over the world. And I see the Arabs now just this week, are doing the same thing in the golf world. But I said to this, uh, he's, he's the husband of one of our nieces. I said to you, how can you make a living out statistics for cricket?  
Speaker 2    01:11:53    'cause he was working for this very well known organization. He said, Michael, do you realize how many people play cricket? How many people are interested in cricket? 'cause I have no interest at all. <laugh>. And he said, look, nevermind England, you've got England, Australia, Pakistan, India, uh, New Zealand, South Africa, right South Africa, the, the Caribbean. He said it's huge. And it is actually, it's probably way bigger than racing ever would be the statistics of it all. And, and he said, it's just so huge. And so people are finding ways to invest money in these things because they're interested in it and so on and so forth. And, um, it's changed the whole world of sports really. It really has. I mean, when you hear football players and people who get a, a couple of million dollars for years, oh, they get wrong that now I, I'm just talking regular, I'm not talking about the stratosphere.  
Speaker 2    01:13:02    But, um, what I'm getting at is that in, in the horse world, it becomes very obvious in a while, which horses are going to be way up in the stratosphere because you get to know who the buyers are, what type of horse they're looking for and so on. And they have loose money. There is so much loose money in the world at the moment. I mean, we, we, we get an, a sales catalog from England for an antique, well auction house that sells all sorts of furniture and paintings and antiques and so on. And, um, the prices now that some of the most ridiculous, do you ever watch an antiques roadshow? Yeah. I mean, you know, bits of paper with scrawl on them and somebody pays a million dollars for it, but just two people get pigheaded and they don't know what to do with their loose change <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    01:14:09    So that's affected racing.  
Speaker 2    01:14:11    Yeah, definitely. Absolutely. Um, the prices, at first it was around, as I say, the colonies and so on and so, and, and Europe a little bit. But then it got further and further afield. I used to do business with Australia and New Zealand, partly because I enjoyed them all. <laugh>. I couldn't see, I could probably have made more money in other ways, but I'm a bit naughty about it. I don't enjoy the client. I can't really enjoy the job, you know, and to, to buy a nice horse for a nice person. That's the real, and, and I can never explain that to people. You know, they didn't understand. Well, why didn't you, one time we had, uh, lazy Lane Farm here, right? And, um, he, he was a client of mine. And, um, I told him, look, this is a must buy animal, you know, you absolutely got to buy this animal.  
Speaker 2    01:15:18    And he asked me how much I thought he would have to pay. And I said, well, nobody's ever bid a hundred thou, nobody's ever been, been a million. And I, I said, you, you are looking at a million dollars and this is when a million was a million. And he said, okay, and if you think it's that good and so on. And, um, uh, I, I got, we were in there in the sales ring and bidding. And when we got to a million, he said, well, he turned to me. He said, well, what do I do now? I said, Mr. His name, she's recording him. Um, thing of me anyway. I said, what you do, you stop. And he said, oh, and he would've gone on, you know, and I said, you don't want to make a fool of yourself by bidding somebody who doesn't care how much he spends you stop.  
Speaker 2    01:16:21    But most people, and it's not a matter of in integrity, it's a matter of something different would say, oh, kick on. You know, because you, you're working for a commission and so on so forth. But, um, my my point is, I mean, grim is trying to buy a couple of horses now for his stable. And he can't compete because he likes the nice horses, which other people are prepared regardless, right. To give tens of millions of dollars. And it's the same in the art world. It's the same in the real estate even. It's, it's a crazy, crazy situation.  
Speaker 0    01:17:09    Too much money. And then the people that don't have it, but still want nice horses or nice houses.  
Speaker 2    01:17:16    Yeah. And, and then the, the other thing is when they realize how the, the reality hits them. I mean, I, I can go and look up the racing form big racing going on this weekend, and I can find you horses running at Belmont that have cost well over a million dollars that haven't even won a race yet. Haven't  
Speaker 1    01:17:37    Broken them in.  
Speaker 2    01:17:38    Right. I mean, the, the odds are 80 who won against you.  
Speaker 1    01:17:46    There's also the, the  
Speaker 2    01:17:49    Endless  
Speaker 1    01:17:50    Chances of, of maybe making a stallion, which will bring in you a great deal of money. I mean, you either speculate on the stock market or you speculate in horses. This is what often when the stock market is not doing much, isn't it? Yeah. They'll,  
Speaker 2    01:18:03    Yeah. That's why I say best. They don't know what to do with their money.  
Speaker 1    01:18:06    It's a sort of, you know, you're speculating, you're speculating on on the success of the horses.  
Speaker 2    01:18:12    Well, and some people, but I, I used to say to people who, oh, I want to, I want to get into this game. It looks so good. It looks so, I said, if you can afford to write off 80% of the money that you put into the horses, I work with you. If not, I'm not interested. And um, and then I had a few people who, who would trust my judgment. And I had another guy that was big in the business and he was a businessman. He ran a very business like stable and he was selling some horses outta his stable. And this other guy came to me and he, his his agent and said, have you got anything nice? You can show me? I said, yes, I got something really nice, I can show you, but it's not gonna cost anything. And we bought a nice horse for about 5,000, just over $5,000. And he went off and he won races and so on. But you gotta get dead luck. You gotta  
Speaker 1    01:19:25    Get luck. I've gotta tell you another story about the Rectortown House. Have you noticed the English oak on the corner? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. On the corner of Crenshaw and the big Yes. It's gotten bigger and bigger. That's an acorn of 83. I bought it back about yay big in the inside of a paper towel roll. 'cause I wouldn't do it now. I wouldn't get away with it now. And I packed it just under the handle of my suitcase. So when you picked it up, all the weight was away from it and it survived. And that's an <inaudible> of 83 out of the family Churchyard in la in, in Surrey where Mike was born and raised and very close to where I was. And these, these are grandchildren, <laugh> of the, these are from Acorns from that tree that they're very hard to grow. Oaks are very slow to start. And it's, and I put 'em outside and they, um, all this lovely new green, the, uh, chipmunks will not leave them alone. And I haven't had anything that I could put them behind. They chewed salmon. And so anyway, I've saved them. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But those grandchildren of the English oak trees and the family church out where that's amazing. Where Claire was married and the boys were, but  
Speaker 2    01:20:44    Scree generations of our family is there. Yes.  
Speaker 1    01:20:46    What town is that? Le, L-E-I-G-H. And  
Speaker 2    01:20:51    That's, it's just a tiny village,  
Speaker 1    01:20:53    Just near Right. It's a very small village.  
Speaker 0    01:20:56    Are there trends in horses? Hmm? Are there trends in horses?  
Speaker 2    01:21:02    Trends? There are trends in horse ownership and reputation. Yes. Breeding mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, I mean, everybody now wants to be a dresser rider. Right. They like the idea of the fancy gear and all. A lot of it is ego.  
Speaker 1    01:21:22    It's safer than jumping too.  
Speaker 2    01:21:24    Hmm.  
Speaker 1    01:21:25    It's safer than jumping.  
Speaker 2    01:21:27    Yeah. Well, but, um, a I made one terrible booboo once I had a client, but in Kentucky who was very rich in construction and they were trying to get into the racing thoroughbred business, but they were interested in the saddlebreds and, you know, the pacing horses and the walk Tennessee walking horses, all these things. So I arranged for them. I thought this'll smarten their ego up a little bit. I arranged for them to bring some horses, Tennessee walking horses and celebrate horses to England to do a demonstration with their horses at the Horse of the Year show in London. And these women came all makeup and glitters and top hats. And this, it was the most utter disaster. The English hated it. They absolutely hated it. And they'd attested these people for coming and doing it. And I, I'm glad not too many people realized that I'd organized the whole thing to rub their ego up. <laugh>. That was the biggest boo boo I ever made. I think horse, we talk too much about horses. I mean, we're not talking about the Middleburg. And what I notice so much about Middleburg is that it has now become a very professional town. And it, it's part of the reason why we moved in here from Rectortown. You've got the banks, the dentists, the lawyers, we move  
Speaker 1    01:23:25    Because it's a one story  
Speaker 2    01:23:26    House. I'm, I'm within walking distance of everything I need in Middleburg. Right. And hard as it was to give up that lovely house in rec the time which we really enjoyed the traffic was got what got to me. And Joe rightly said, you know, what's happened? She said, people have all got these shortcut electronic things. Yeah. And they're all doing a shortcut. West stop. 66. That's what, and we had the devil a time even stopping the lumber trucks going through there.  
Speaker 1    01:24:02    Those, those with all the pine,  
Speaker 2    01:24:05    You know, the big trailer trucks. We had a level of a job. We, we did get that done.  
Speaker 1    01:24:10    But they were going through Rectortown. They were coming up 17,  
Speaker 2    01:24:14    They were coming up 17 through Rectortown getting off at Marshall. Oh, well, I  
Speaker 0    01:24:18    Never understand why the trucks have been pushed off. 17. It seems to me like that  
Speaker 1    01:24:23    Would be Well, it's extraordinary because sometimes you see  
Speaker 2    01:24:26    <crosstalk>, 'cause 17, the pe the people along 17 were much better organized. And it was like chasing chickens. It was the danger,  
Speaker 1    01:24:36    It was the danger angle. Look, I've got to show you this, this is, this is lie. This is where Mike was <laugh>. Oh, that's beautiful. And, and that's the where's where's the priest house? This is the house he was actually living in. It's right next door to the church. This is the church used to be that roof, didn't it, Mike? I think it was.  
Speaker 2    01:24:56    But anyway, before my time,  
Speaker 1    01:24:58    Darling. Yes, I know, but originally it was. But um, may  
Speaker 2    01:25:01    I take, I, I think, I think that one time. Oh  
Speaker 1    01:25:04    Yes.  
Speaker 2    01:25:06    I think that one time, um, it, you know, several hundred years ago it had a, that roof from the, you know, people tried to warm the church and high support for, but my mother's house was rock immediately opposite the, the church gate of the church in the village. And, um, that, that's where is,  
Speaker 1    01:25:34    It's just a little village. It's, it's smaller than this. It's great. I mean,  
Speaker 2    01:25:37    Oh, it's time. A  
Speaker 1    01:25:38    Village store. They've only got one village store,  
Speaker 2    01:25:40    So they don't even have that. It's bit more  
Speaker 1    01:25:42    Rent. I don't think they have  
Speaker 2    01:25:43    That. They haven't had one for 20 no years. That's true too. But when I, when I was a kid, we had a village bakery, a village store, post office. Um,  
Speaker 1    01:25:57    But anyway, it's, it's not unlike  
Speaker 2    01:26:00    But those places in, in the villages, um, you know, they, they couldn't compete with these big chains anymore. It's not, and everybody, everybody has a motor car now.  
Speaker 1    01:26:13    But the traffic did get very bad in Rector tide. I mean, it's, it's just, it  
Speaker 2    01:26:18    Got, but I, I got stopped by one of the, uh, uh, four care sheriff deputies one time standing outside with, with a hairdryer <laugh> pointing at these cars as they came through. And he said, you know, that is illegal. You can't do that. I think he was slightly am immune.  
Speaker 1    01:26:43    I think you miss some of 'em because they come down the hill and then they go left at the bottom of the hill. They don't all go, there's  
Speaker 2    01:26:48    That time. There's only six, there's only a couple hundred yards. But oh my God, in the, he, he  
Speaker 1    01:26:54    Let it get to him. This is half the trouble. I mean, he, he'd come in swearing from working on the bank and the traffic and things.  
Speaker 2    01:27:00    I mean, and there's nowhere. It's  
Speaker 1    01:27:02    Where you want to live there. You just put  
Speaker 2    01:27:03    Up with it. There's nowhere on that stretch from the, if you go down the Otoka road and you come to the, uh, Marshall Road, there's t junction, there's nowhere from that T junction for several miles in either direction where they can safely pull somebody off the road. And that's the real key.  
Speaker 1    01:27:30    There's no,  
Speaker 2    01:27:31    They can't enforce it. So they don't, don't try. I had a good relationship with one of the sheriffs at one time, and he actually parked a empty sheriffs car with a silhouette of a deputy in, and that didn't work right outside the house you I live in mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:27:54    And that did more than, than many  
Speaker 2    01:27:56    Of things. But the commuters they get to know in five minutes. But when they've seen that in place for three days,  
Speaker 1    01:28:04    We're still very happy that we've wound up in Middleburg. The first, you know, the kids wanted us to move because the stairs in the old houses, they're a little bit narrow and mm-hmm <affirmative>. Steepy. And they were afraid he was going to come down the stairs. The first thing he did when he hadn't been here five minutes was he fell in, I was in the shop. He fell in the sitting room. I came home to find him on the floor of the sitting room with a broken hip.  
Speaker 2    01:28:29    But he got, it wouldn't have happened over there. No. You know why, why? 'cause he was used to it. 'cause it was a safe staircase. The steps were steep and the tread wasn't very, but had good banisters very wide, but it had good banisters that you can hold onto.  
Speaker 1    01:28:44    Now. He tells me,  
Speaker 0    01:28:48    Well, if you can, I see you out walking here. I mean, you can walk from here  
Speaker 1    01:28:52    And you can, I'm done if I do. No, I've seen,  
Speaker 2    01:28:55    Well, I'm having a war with the town people about the broken steps behind the library. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. The broken handrail, because I go to the jungle gym there and do my Pilates exercises on it every day. And that's a little walk and it. Right. I get my Pilates exercise, get up and  
Speaker 1    01:29:16    Down the stairs  
Speaker 2    01:29:17    Now. But the, the people who were doing the landing landscaping there and keep it right. Bus a railing, and they never replaced it. And I been to the town office and I've spoken to Mr. Moore, who is the deputy mayor, apparently, or deputy manager, I'm not sure. And I said, you know, there are three sets of stairs between the library and the community center. They are concrete steps and they, none of them have any rail at all, anywhere. And I said, people use that as a footpath. You know, I meet people there walking back from Safeway with their bags and stuff. And he, he looked into it and he said, well, the library steps are under the jurisdiction of the Loudoun County Library system. You know, so here we are, we've gotta go to blooming Loudoun. Um, the steps, steps the steps on the, of the field by behind the swimming pool, that grass area. There is another jurisdiction. And then the community center, the steps there are the jurisdiction of the community center. So you've got to deal with three people. And they won't, they won't do anything about. So I, I've been after them. Uh, but everybody's so fast with this damn thing of the salamander and the expansion of the office that nobody's got time to pay attention to something like,  
Speaker 1    01:31:06    Well, I'm fascinated that you can hear that from here. Yeah. Well, you've heard it all morning, haven't you? Yeah. And can you imagine how, um, what's his name up there? Uh, you know, come I I'm having a terrible day with names. Um, what happens when you get old <laugh> Paul, Paul  
Speaker 2    01:31:29    Croney. Oh, Paul Crony  
Speaker 1    01:31:30    Right beside it. And he's going, Dotty anyway. 'cause he used to live in Rectortown. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 2    01:31:38    Well, did you, did you know Mary?  
Speaker 1    01:31:40    I had just moved to Rectortown and, and met her.  
Speaker 2    01:31:45    It's a shame. Very lovely woman. She's  
Speaker 1    01:31:47    A very good, she was perfect for recti time, you know,  
Speaker 2    01:31:51    And she was lovely woman. She  
Speaker 1    01:31:52    Was doing so much. It was really absolutely unbelievable that something so silly should happened. I mean, she was, she hit the ground and she was dead. And then there was no, she broke her neck. Astonishing. But anyway, it was very hard. And then she was just the right person for a back of time because she was very interested in the history of it. You know,  
Speaker 2    01:32:23    The th the thing that I noticed the big change is, is I, I I, I tell people there's a group of people in Fairfax and that way east of people who are trying to make Middleburg into Georgetown. It's Georgetown in the fields. Uh, and that is so destructive to what Middleburg really is or was.  
Speaker 1    01:32:52    Well, I think it's still is. And how would you define Middleburg?  
Speaker 2    01:32:58    How would I define it now? I don't  
Speaker 1    01:33:00    Think I would be prepared to tell you that. I think I could, I'd have to think about that.  
Speaker 2    01:33:11    How would I define it? Well, it, it has become a tourist destination. And the merchants of Middleburg on the whole are catering to a totally different group of people who come out and are, um, well, they, they, they're coming out with, with the idea, as I say it, it, it's sort of, I don't know how to, how to describe it. I mean, it, it, it still  
Speaker 1    01:34:07    Got a warm feeling  
Speaker 2    01:34:10    Under, underneath the surface. There is still a very central, warm, friendly, caring surface. But on the top, there's this sort of icing that the visitors are all looking for. And accordingly, there are people coming in and setting up businesses which appeal to the  
Speaker 2    01:34:45    New people, the Novi hoes, as they used to call them in England, um, who are looking for something spectacular and make, make them feel good. And it, it, it, it's a different, i I, I believe that the mayor that we have now is an absolutely top, top guy. I think he's brilliant because he was born and raised. I think he's done everything that he could possibly do through the Covid thing. He's tried hard to maintain the spirit of the, of the residents. I think he's been brilliant, and I hope to God he stays there for a long time. But at the time that he was running for, to start, I, well remember some fellow in a, I don't know, a Bentley or whatever, it was an open sports car. Well, not a sports car, but like an open carriage driving through the town, waving his hat to people.  
Speaker 2    01:35:49    And he was trying to run for mayor. I don't know if he ever lived here. I don't think he did. I think one of the best of the old time things that Middleburg is doing is Windy Hill. I'm a huge, I'm, I'm not a practical supporter. I I, I don't have the money to do what, but I think Windy Hill absolutely has it right. And I, I wish them all the best in the world to keep going. I think it's a brilliant idea. But what happens to the next people? Do the Windy Hill people really move on and, and, and other working people, blue collar people come behind them? Or does the Windy Hill people, is there a, is there a, uh, is there a means by which they have to move up, move, move on, or, or give up? Or are they going to sit on these houses and bottle 'em up and sell them to people who think it's a smart place to live?  
Speaker 2    01:36:57    I, I don't know. I, I, I, I very much, I, I fully approve of the mayor. I fully approve of the Windy Hill. But people told me I shouldn't be worried about what comes next. We're great grandparents, <laugh>, we do worry great grandparents about what comes next. Yes. I had another friend, he was actually a client who was very friendly with, and this has nothing to do with Middleburg, who at the time of, uh, all the psychedelic drugs, you know, 40 years ago, whenever it was, were so rampant in this country, he picked up his entire family and moved it to island. He said, I would not risk my children in that environment in America. And that environment is always nagging at us. And we are so close to Washington. The thing I like about here is if I was in Idaho, I don't know who I'd make friends with and who I'd find of interest and so on. There are so many, and this was true of the bloodstock business. There were so many people from so many different spheres that it was always interesting. There's always somebody interesting to talk to. There was always something in the, in the job that I was doing, there was always somebody who was from a different field. And I find that very interesting. And I wouldn't find that in I either Idaho or Nebraska or wherever. At least I don't think I would  
Speaker 1    01:38:43    For a country area. There's a lot of sophistication.  
Speaker 2    01:38:46    Yeah, that's, that's, that's correct. You've hit it on the head. That's probably true.  
Speaker 1    01:38:50    And I'm not sure that it's, um,  
Speaker 2    01:38:52    But earlier on, 40 or 50 years ago, when, well, more than that, 60, 70 years ago, um, and when Joe was first coming here with the horses and so on, it wasn't like that at all. It, it was people who, but but  
Speaker 1    01:39:11    There were bigger states in those  
Speaker 2    01:39:12    States.  
Speaker 1    01:39:13    There's a lot of money about, in bigger states,  
Speaker 2    01:39:15    The, the, the, the melons really influenced the best of landowners in the area. And, and it inevitably, it brought in some very, very nice people. Very good people. I mean, you take somebody like Mrs. Mars, she's fabulous for this district, but so, but she could be like this guy who's got western, uh, plastic western horses in his field and a helicopter pad. She said, you exact opposite. She's like, melon. She doesn't drive around in a fancy car with chauffeur and all this stuff. You,  
Speaker 1    01:39:59    Well, she's so quiet about what she does do in a accomplishing back and all this stuff. It was amazing.  
Speaker 2    01:40:06    I mean, I don't even know the lady, but I know what she does. And I ran into her thing at the National Sporting Library, and I just said to her, Mrs. Miles, you don't know me, but I'd like to thank you for what you're doing to this area. 'cause people need to know, I, I didn't say anything else. And she just was very nice. She smile and said, thank you. And that was her. And, um, there are some very, very good people. The Kennedy family didn't really help, I don't think. <laugh>,  
Speaker 1    01:40:43    They didn't have time,  
Speaker 2    01:40:44    But, but Mel Mellon and, um, uh, what, what's, uh, oh, the other landowner that, um, I can't remember. But, but, but the, there've been several very good people who've done a lot for the countryside. I think Piedmont Environmental Council is very good. Tremendous. I think that  
Speaker 1    01:41:15    That's probably what we halfway say, preserve so  
Speaker 2    01:41:19    Quietly  
Speaker 1    01:41:19    On the top of whatever goes on with the states, with the land and things, aren't they, they're really on top of things. And I don't know how much noise they can make if something they don't like. But,  
Speaker 2    01:41:32    And I, I, I  
Speaker 1    01:41:33    Quite a bit I think in the background, but the problem is it's the profit, you know? Well, the day you go, I mean,  
Speaker 2    01:41:41    At the end of the day, but there's nothing like the, the visible black community in the village now that there was 60, 70 years ago, there, you, you'd see plenty of black people in the street and sitting in the parks and on the benches and chatting and, and they were always, I mean, I know a lot of them were grooms and groundsmen and so on, but they were always treated as human beings. And, and even at the racetrack, when Joe was at the racetrack, the, the Negro people were pretty good, weren't they? They were good sorts. 'cause they,  
Speaker 1    01:42:26    They were what the  
Speaker 2    01:42:26    Mexican, and a lot of them came from here because they came with the horses. And, but a  
Speaker 1    01:42:30    A lot of the Mexican help now has,  
Speaker 2    01:42:32    Has  
Speaker 1    01:42:33    Replaced the black community in, you hardly see anybody working in  
Speaker 2    01:42:37    The <crosstalk>, the southern immigrants. Now, I shouldn't, I shouldn't say against anything against them, but they have changed the entire character of the United States. And I say that with deep respect because we have a lady who comes and cleans for us. Um, twice a month. She came as a 19-year-old girl speaking, no word of English. She has just seen her son graduate from VMI to a Fulbright scholarship in France and done it from nothing. And she has another son. And she came for the  
Speaker 1    01:43:22    Other son to be there at  
Speaker 2    01:43:24    VMI. And, and she has another son in the pipeline, whom I have no doubt will be just as good.  
Speaker 1    01:43:31    Oh, he's, he's there Mike now, and they, he got a, he got a much smaller scholarship. The other one got a free ride right through VMI. And, and he's, uh, mind you, she's a very, her English is excellent. I'm not sure you're right about she came at 19. I thought  
Speaker 2    01:43:49    She told me, Joe. Okay. Okay. I asked her.  
Speaker 1    01:43:52    I thought that it  
Speaker 2    01:43:52    Was early. I was very dnt about asking her because I was afraid that she was perhaps not with the right papers or something. And I've been very dent about asking her, but I'm a 19-year-old, and, uh,  
Speaker 1    01:44:09    She's the best cleaner I've ever had.  
Speaker 2    01:44:13    But she's the best person you could meet, you know. But it has caused enormous social pressure on, on the black people. And I think a lot of the trouble now is, is almost, it's almost like a fifth column. The, this whole business of, of the, the riots in, in Washington and so on. And how a bully, like, uh, Trump can brainwash these people the way he does. I  
Speaker 1    01:44:56    He  
Speaker 2    01:44:56    Brainwashes themselves, the black people. I'm not saying they were content as slaves, and a lot of them were very badly treaty, but a lot of them were, they've, they've proved themselves that they're not inferior people. They were given inferior opportunities. I don't know. I do realize she's got, you're getting me on my high horse.  
Speaker 1    01:45:24    Well, I think you gotta get off that. Taken a lot of your time.  
Speaker 2    01:45:27    Really. No,  
Speaker 1    01:45:29    Listen, old age can get extraordinarily boring. This is my trouble. I shouldn't have given up the shop, or I should have cut back. I should have given it up partly, Andrew says I'm a lot less stressed without it. But I wasn't aware that I was stressed with it.  
Speaker 2    01:45:45    Well, you were the only person who wasn't aware.  
Speaker 1    01:45:48    Oh, okay. Well there you go. But it's, um, well, I've really enjoyed my time here with you, so thank you so much.  
Speaker 2    01:45:55    We've overstepped, uh, mark.
