Speaker 1    00:01:06    Well, yes, I was. I knew that I was coming from, uh, growing up on a ranch, um, and being in the country, you know, with that kind of living, I was coming to the same sort of, of life, um, in Upperville. Right. The  
Speaker 0    00:01:25    Farm. And, and what did you, uh, do for, at the beginning of your marriage? Tell me what your husband did and what kind of life you had here.

Uh, we worked cattle together and horses and, uh, it was just on a smaller scale, but it was, it was very unique. It, it was very special.  
Speaker 0    00:01:59    When you say smaller scale, what was the, um, operation you had in New Mexico?  
Speaker 1    00:02:06    Well, you need a lot more land in New Mexico than you do here. 'cause, uh, for grass and grazing and mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, so it's, it's a large ranch and it's been in the family for five generations. That's amazing. Under the fifth generation.  
Speaker 0    00:02:21    And so you mean because it's less fert, less green there?  
Speaker 1    00:02:24    Well, it's just le Yes. The vegetation is not conducive to grass. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. As, um, it is here. And we don't get the rain. Like, we have an eight Right. Eight inch annual  
Speaker 0    00:02:37    Rain. So it takes more per cow to raise them. Oh, yes. A  
Speaker 1    00:02:40    Lot more. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:02:41    <affirmative>. What kind of cattle were you raising?  
Speaker 1    00:02:44    Um, we had Angus cattle on my mother, uh, on the mountain ranch. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then on the bottom ranch was her. There were Herefords. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then they started cross-breeding, and it's a mix now. Right. And my husband stuck in Asure with mostly the Angus mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:03:01    <affirmative>. And at the, at the point in time when you came to Asure, can you tell me about the property at that time?  
Speaker 1    00:03:10    Oh, it was beautiful. It was wonderful. It still is. Um,  
Speaker 2    00:03:16    <affirmative>,  
Speaker 1    00:03:18    Tommy's great aunt, Mrs. Jones, lived in the big house. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And within walking distance were, were the stables and the manager's house, which was just a darling house. The two story house is where Tommy and I lived. And then each one of my children, uh, lived there until, uh, they went away to college. And I lived there until we sold the farm. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:03:48    So did you ever move into the big house or did you  
Speaker 1    00:03:51    No, never. Never wanted to. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:03:53    That's  
Speaker 1    00:03:54    The little house. So to the upkeep, <laugh>. Right. It was beautiful. And we went there for dinner and we went there for, uh, just seeing in the evening, visiting with Aunt Helen, but mm-hmm <affirmative>. No, I never wanted to live in the big house. He didn't either. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:04:09    And, um, how long did she live there? When did she die?  
Speaker 1    00:04:14    1981, I think it was, um, around 1981. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she, she lived there and in Puerto Rico, most of her life back and forth, she traveled a lot.  
Speaker 0    00:04:26    And what was her f full name?  
Speaker 1    00:04:28    Helen Buchanan Jones. She was married and had no children, but had no children. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And her husband died, um, early, and she was a widow. Uh, she was a delightful woman. And then Tom's mother inherited it. Right. And, uh, she lived in Warrenton, and she just came to live there at the end of her life.  
Speaker 0    00:04:53    And so she lived, she then lived in that Uhhuh  
Speaker 1    00:04:55    Big house at the end of her life. Right. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:04:58    And when you, um, came here, how many acres was that property?  
Speaker 1    00:05:06    Just under 800. Under  
Speaker 0    00:05:07    800. And how many cows?  
Speaker 2    00:05:13    I,  
Speaker 1    00:05:14    I don't remember. I don't, I don't remember. They were, you know, in different fields. And we'd go out in the evening and the truck and check 'em, and with Tommy and the children in the back. Um, but we had cattle all over the place, but we were working cattle and shipping them, selling them. It was a constant evolving. Right. Um,  
Speaker 0    00:05:41    And so for someone who has never had that kind of life, can you give me a picture of what a typical day would've looked like for you?  
Speaker 1    00:05:52    Uh, well, early up <laugh>, uh, um, when the children were little, I would take them down to the barns to stay with the woman that lived down there so that we could work cattle. They stayed with Nanny, they called her Nanny. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and she would watch the little ones. And when they got to the point of being at school, I'd have to do the carpool and take them. Uh, but we always came back and worked in the office and did the books and did the planning. Uh, no computers at the time, so it was all by hand ledger. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, and we did that and we'd go to cattle sales, um, a lot of times, you know, to be visual or buy, but mostly just to be visual in the business. And, um, it was just, it was a very simple operation, but it was a very clean, thorough, um, plan that my husband had. Tommy Stokes.  
Speaker 0    00:07:01    And tell me about Tommy Stokes. He was born, was he born here?  
Speaker 1    00:07:05    He was born, uh, in Philadelphia, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And, but his parents divorced and he was brought back to Warrenton where his mother lived when he was two or three years old. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And so he grew up in Warrenton, but going to prep schools and all. Um, and he got in the cattle business through four H. Um, and even though he was away at school, he, he had some four H camps that kept on the, the place in Warton mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then he went to, um, ask Mrs. Jones, Ms. Great aunt, if he could come and work at Air shirt when, before we married. And she, in turn, before he had a chance to ask, she asked him if he would. So it turned out to be That's  
Speaker 0    00:07:53    Interesting. So that he went to meet with her and she  
Speaker 1    00:07:55    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Then she turned it on, turned it around and said, will you come and manage er? So, um, they, they were very close mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I was very close to his mother, very close to his  
Speaker 0    00:08:08    Mother. And tell me where, um, her place was in Warrenton,  
Speaker 1    00:08:12    Meadowville Farms.  
Speaker 0    00:08:13    Oh, I've seen that. Uhhuh <affirmative>. Right. So that's on 17th  
Speaker 1    00:08:17    Uhhuh <affirmative> on that St. Meadowville stretch.  
Speaker 0    00:08:19    Right, right. That's a beautiful place. She  
Speaker 1    00:08:21    Had grown up at, um, oh, another place in Warton, and it just went right out of my aunt. Um, but she grew up there in Warton. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She went away to school, and then she used to come home and, um, hunt on the weekends, and then she didn't want to go back to school. Right. So pretty soon they pulled her out of old oilfields and they put her in the school in Warrenton and mm-hmm <affirmative>. She finished her education there.  
Speaker 0    00:08:49    And what was her name?  
Speaker 1    00:08:51    Polly Buchanan.  
Speaker 0    00:08:52    Polly Buchanan. And the Buchanan family is, uh, has Buchanan Hall.  
Speaker 1    00:09:01    Yes. That was, that was the general Anne Helen's father is built that, or finance that to be built. And he was general, uh, James Buchanan.  
Speaker 0    00:09:15    And, um, what was his history?  
Speaker 1    00:09:19    Well, he's the, they all, the Buchanans grew up here locally. They're two different Buchanan families that they're not related. Right. Um, he married a woman from the New England, and I can't remember why he came to Virginia, but he, he bought the place at Asure and or built the big house with all the stone come, coming from the farm, um, and got in the horse business and had a place in the, in DC mm-hmm <affirmative>. And lived there too. And Anne Helen was his hostess, um, when his wife died. Right. Um, and re just went from a horse operation, mainly horse operation, which we still had horses too, but then Tommy moved it into the cattle.  
Speaker 0    00:10:19    Into the cattle. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And so had, had Helen been doing the cattle, or when did the general die? Do you know that date?  
Speaker 1    00:10:30    Uh, no, I don't. 'cause it was before I was Right. Came,  
Speaker 0    00:10:37    Um, I can probably find out more about that. That's really interesting. So Buchanan Hall then was a place that he, um,  
Speaker 1    00:10:47    Uh, I'm not sure I should have asked Adam of Stormy. I can't because she was president of it mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I can't remember, uh, if the community built it and named it for him, and he helped finance it, I think is  
Speaker 0    00:11:01    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:11:02    You think that's,  
Speaker 0    00:11:03    I think that is correct. I think that's the way that, that it was a community effort.  
Speaker 1    00:11:07    We committed, we, we count on it being a community, um, place we want for years, we tried to bring the community mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, in with, we used to have wonderful parties, um, in the summertime. And the children, you know, would have watermelon feast, rolled watermelons, uh, the baking goods, everybody contributed, um, in the community. It was really a wonderful, a, a wonderful summer experience that we had. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Children. Loved it.  
Speaker 0    00:11:45    What was winter here like? Did you have, was it a bit,  
Speaker 1    00:11:49    A lot more snow <laugh>. A lot more snow? Yeah. We were snowed in many times without heat. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, I'd bring bundle the children up with hats and coats and all, and we'd sleep in front of the fireplace at our little house to stay warm. Um, Tommy and I would go out in the mornings then to check the cattle. And sometimes, I remember one time we sort of had to roll out across the snow drift that had come up to the, towards the door. And we walked out and got across the cattle guard and there was a little black head stuck up. It was a little Angus cab. And Tommy went to try to pull it up out of the snow, and the ear just came right off. Mm.  
Speaker 0    00:12:34    It was frozen.  
Speaker 1    00:12:35    We, you know, we really had snowstorms. Um, I have a picture of the children that are up on at the entrance. Right. It's sitting under the big sign that said, aha Farm, you know, that just, and then getting out sometimes we, uh, were there for a week. And I remember that Aunt Helen needed medicine one time, and they got it as far as Upperville, uh, the store there, Mrs. O' Store and Elizabeth Plaskitt. Do you remember her? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She cross country, skied that medicine into airship. She picked it up because they lived across the street from it. Right. The store. And she came on her cross country skis.  
Speaker 0    00:13:17    I can remember that. Even when we lived down at the corner here. Yeah. Um, our driveway was so far back that I remember cross country skiing down. We hadn't been able to get the car up the driveway. So we walked up, and then I would cross country ski down, go to the town, come back, <laugh>, get the groceries.  
Speaker 1    00:13:40    It was a great lot though, wasn't it? Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:13:42    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:13:42    Yeah. It really was special. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:13:45    Um, when, what was the, um, social fabric of the community like at when you came here? It must, was it,  
Speaker 1    00:13:57    Well, you know, I was asked this, uh, yesterday of somebody really, um, my, the social, uh, experiences that I started with came through the church mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, which is, was natural for me because growing up in New Mexico, you know, living out in the country church meant a lot to us. Um, that's where I met the older women who really took me under their wing. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, the debuts women and the Plaskitt women, uh, all in the church. And, um, that's where I started the Sunday school. Um, <laugh>, I had three children. Two of 'em were mine, <laugh>,  
Speaker 1    00:14:42    The other one was a Bentley. Um, it, the, everything sort of for me was surrounded, was inside the church surrounding sort of things. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, um, gradually then I, which was easy because the families around here had all been at Air Shere many, many times with, and Alan's parties. So she would have these parties than I'd meet more and more of their children. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Young people who were my age. And it was a, it's, it's a real wonderful village. They protect, we to protect each other. We, uh, support each other. It takes a village and we do it right. And it's been that way the whole time since I've been here.  
Speaker 0    00:15:32    So it was a very welcoming community. Welcom, when you came here, very welcoming. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Must have been a huge difference from just even being cold <laugh>. Like you must have felt very different here. Um,  
Speaker 1    00:15:44    I did, but I felt, um, uh, I felt safe the same way I do in New Mexico, because family comes first. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And Tommy's family was just wonderful. And he loved my family. Right. Uh, and he loved New Mexico. Just like, I loved Virginia, but the family was the, the core mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, uh, I had sister-in-laws and I had brother-in-laws and the nieces, and, you know, and I still have it. I still have it.  
Speaker 0    00:16:17    And so, when you came, um, what family did he have here?  
Speaker 1    00:16:23    Tell me. Had his mother and his sister and a brother. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and his brother went to prep school and Helen Wiley, then she went to prep school too. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Before she married. Um, I was very close to Tommy's mother. We were really best friends. Um, and did a lot together. Uh, that was the, his family with Aunt Allen, who was the, and she brought in all the ones on the fringes, all the nephew in-laws and the nieces and the, their children and all. And the Christmas time, they would all come to Asure and it would be quite a large group.  
Speaker 0    00:17:04    That's wonderful.  
Speaker 1    00:17:05    And we'd always have our Christmas meal. And, oh, the big tree was so big. It was, it had to reach from this side to that side, to that side up there. And, and I used to, at the end, I was the one that decorated it, going up on the ladder. Um, 'cause Malachi, who used to work for, couldn't go up on the ladder at the end, but mm-hmm <affirmative>. He directed and she directed. She said, there are too many red balls on that side. So I turned the ladder over and, but it was just, it, you know. Oh. And I blew the whole, all, all the electricity on Christmas Eve. One time I plugged it in and I blew everything Christmas Eve. And we got a man to come from Marshall, and he, because Aunt Helen had to go up and down in the elevator. She couldn't walk the stairs. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She was elderly. So that left a big mark on the family. <laugh>, I guess, I guess. No, we, it, it was very special.  
Speaker 0    00:18:06    What was your, um, Christmas tradit? What were some of your Chris Christmas traditions, uh, that when you got together?  
Speaker 1    00:18:13    Well, Christmas Eve, of course, is the, the most special, um, to me and to my family. It was because that was when people started coming, you know. And, uh, I always had the Christmas Eve dinners at my, my little house. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Which is my little house. I just loved it. Um, and then Christmas morning we did our presents and then got dressed up, and we went to the big house for the big Christmas, and the prac gifts were passed out. Then we went into the dining room and had the big dinner, and it was big table. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And it was, it was, it was something you looked forward to.  
Speaker 0    00:18:59    And did you go to church on Christmas?  
Speaker 1    00:19:02    Christmas Eve? Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:19:04    So they would go to church and then come back and have dinner. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:19:07    And the children were always in the pageant, uh, until they actually, once they were confirmed, they sort of, you know, they were acolytes and things, but they, they couldn't fit it in as they got older. So it had to become their choice. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:19:27    <affirmative>. And where did your children go to school?  
Speaker 1    00:19:29    Uh, hill School. And then, um, one went to Exeter, one went to Stormy, went to St. Tim's. Um, and Clayburn went a couple of places, <laugh>. But, um, Woodbury is where he went.  
Speaker 0    00:19:47    Um, so they stayed straight. We should back up and say, uh, the names and when your children were born.  
Speaker 1    00:19:55    Uh,  
Speaker 0    00:19:55    Because I know that, but that's  
Speaker 1    00:19:57    <laugh>. My oldest is Philly, Billy William, um, 1964, and Stormy, 1966, and Clayburn 1971. And Clayburn is the only one that doesn't live around here. I lives in Mobile, but he loved farming. And once the farm was sold, he, he knew he couldn't, he just couldn't stay.  
Speaker 0    00:20:25    When was the farm sold? What year was that?  
Speaker 1    00:20:29    Oh, goodness. Uh, Tommy died, uh, I 96 and the farm sold just bef it sold before he died. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I think that's right. He's been gone 23 years, is that, I think.  
Speaker 0    00:20:45    And what was his birthday?  
Speaker 1    00:20:47    January 14th, 1939.  
Speaker 0    00:20:50    So you were close.  
Speaker 1    00:20:52    Yes, we were. He was just a little bit older. <laugh> uh, Clayburn was born on his birthday, too.  
Speaker 0    00:20:58    Oh, that's amazing.  
Speaker 1    00:20:59    I said, well, I don't know what to give you for your birthday, so here's Clayburn.  
Speaker 0    00:21:07    And then he loved to farm, so that was perfect. Yeah,  
Speaker 1    00:21:10    He did, he loved to  
Speaker 0    00:21:11    Farm. And does he farm now?  
Speaker 1    00:21:13    No, he doesn't. But he had a, a leasing for John Deere in Mobile. So he gets to get on the machines, and every time they have a hurricane, of course, he, he makes the deals to get the equipment out to people, leases as well. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Sometimes sells them. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But it's not firing to him.  
Speaker 0    00:21:35    Um, besides, uh, doing things with the church, what kind of other social things were there? Um, in the, in the sixties and seventies?  
Speaker 1    00:21:47    Well, there was a lot of, as I said, families, uh, and village events. Um, Middleburg and Upperville of course, shared, uh, in all our gatherings. And it was pretty social. Uh, some were pretty mild, um, the fun, and you met more interesting people. But, um, the things I used to do, Tommy and I used to do, we would always have picnics and things, and the whole family, we wanted the children always with. So we had cocktail parties, but the, the fun things were the picnics we did that were family invited families to come. And the children used to, some of them children to bus children used to ride their ponies over to re and sit on my front porch and have their drink. And, um, you know, their cookies. And as the boys got older, they started working at Air Shere mm-hmm <affirmative>. For Tommy. And he, he even put in a Coke machine, a coke machine down at the barn.  
Speaker 1    00:23:00    And, but he made 'em put their quarters in. Get, it's always a little bit of a twist to it, <laugh>. Um, but we had a lot of boys that worked for us then young boys, the beach boy. Um, a lot of, and as the boys went away to college, they brought back friends during the summer to work with us too, and live at Atri. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So we had what we called the Boar's Nest was in the corner of the stables near my house, and we fixed it up. So the, it was just a place for all those boys to hang out. Must have been so fun for them. It was fun. And I fed them all. So it was, uh, it was, you know, it was just always activity going on. And the young people really just meant a lot to us.  
Speaker 0    00:23:53    Were there, besides Christmas, were there any other big celebrations in the, um, community that were, um, traditional meaningful <affirmative>?  
Speaker 1    00:24:04    Well, I remember one that I'm not sure it's, uh, one is like the church, the church's, um, fashion show that benefited the church. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. One time. You always had it in different homes. And one time it was an re and it was really fun because Tommy showed his cattle after the fashion show was over, it was the Beauty and the Beast <laugh> sort of thing. <laugh>. It's hilarious. And, um, we had, um, a couple of really fun parties up there with music and dancing. And, um, it was such an easy place to, to do something. And Aunt Helen didn't mind, or, or we did it when she was always out of the country. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, we had a lot of cattle things, um, national cattle things. They wanted to be on the farm, and they'd have picnics and things like that mm-hmm <affirmative>. But as far as, um, the community things went, they were shared at the debuts there, fish fries and things like that. And then we did our picnics and, um, cooked down at the creek in the swimming hole, and the children would swim and we'd have a red eye saloon in the back of the truck. And it was, it was very magic creative.  
Speaker 0    00:25:37    What's the Red Eye Saloon?  
Speaker 1    00:25:38    That was in Tommy's red truck. And that's where he put the Red Bloody Mary's for that morning. And he called it the Red Eye Saloon. Oh, that's, and a big sign in the back.  
Speaker 0    00:25:50    That's really  
Speaker 1    00:25:51    Fun. In the back of his red truck. <laugh>. We weren't too imaginative, but we had fun playing with him.  
Speaker 0    00:25:58    What was he like, Tommy?  
Speaker 1    00:26:00    Oh, he was very outgoing. And he was, um, he was just very well liked. Um, had great friends, and they evolved, you know, as some left when they married and went somewhere else, then others would come in. And we have the same friends. Uh, he didn't hunt like most of the men do. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But he did a lot of other things that they did that they could share. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And think 'em right now. But, um, cattle mostly see cattle.  
Speaker 0    00:26:36    They did cattle, um, did they shoot  
Speaker 1    00:26:43    Tommy didn't really, my, my youngest son, Claver is a hunter. He's, he's the one that shoots and he shot with a lot of people. And, um, that's what kept us sort of involved in that group, group of the ones that Right shot. And I, but Tommy was so well liked. And, um, he was very, um, I don't know. He was very good with the community. The children even put him up for Mayor of Upperville one time and plastered posts on the post office wall and <laugh>. They thought he would make a very good mayor, which embarrassed him. But anyway, um, and he stayed in touch with a lot of friends from school.  
Speaker 0    00:27:32    And where did he go to school?  
Speaker 1    00:27:33    He went <laugh>. Well, he went to, uh, Calver School. Warrington, Woodbury, McDonough, <laugh>, finally Haverford in Pennsylvania. And when he finally got his high school diploma, took him a while. <laugh>, he got kicked out a couple of times. He then went to Oklahoma State, which he loved. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, um, but he, in his junior year, he dropped out and went to work for a, a big ranch in Texas mm-hmm <affirmative>. And never did Fi finish his. Um, and he was in the National Guard, and he loved the Army. He tried to be a Green Beret, but he couldn't pass the requirements. But he, his father was commander at the Philadelphia troop. And so Tommy was a member of the Philadelphia troop, and he did his duty that way. He loved the Army.  
Speaker 0    00:28:34    And his father, um, stayed in Philadelphia. Yes. And did he travel there and, and visit  
Speaker 1    00:28:39    With him? He would go and visit mm-hmm <affirmative>. He would go, uh, every summer. They would go skiing in the winter. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, but he was really, Tommy was really a Virginian. We went to Philadelphia to talk to them about, they wanted us to come up and live there. And Tommy and I did the tours and did all that talking, and then drove home and said, looked at each other and said, it's just not, it's not us, not the Philadelphia life. The, you know, the city life. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:29:10    What did his father do there? He wanted him to join him.  
Speaker 1    00:29:15    I can't remember whether he asked him to, but I imagine he did. He was in the rubber business, uh, commercial. Um, but he did so many things. Paper. Paper. He was in paper and things like that. Um, a commercial that's just wasn't Tommy.  
Speaker 0    00:29:34    Right. But he was not, it was the Buchanan side. That was from Virginia. Yes. It was the mother's  
Speaker 1    00:29:41    Side. And that's what he had really identified with. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:29:47    How old was he when he moved back to Warrenton from Philadelphia when his parents were divorced?  
Speaker 1    00:29:52    About  
Speaker 0    00:29:52    Two. About two. So he really mm-hmm <affirmative>. Grew up  
Speaker 1    00:29:55    Here. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And it, you know, he would go up and try to make it out with, uh, his half siblings. Siblings and all that. But he, he really was a Virginia mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he and his mother were very close.  
Speaker 0    00:30:12    Did she remarry?  
Speaker 1    00:30:14    Uh, twice. Twice. And I knew the, I didn't know. I, Tommy's father and I were very close, but I didn't know the Helen's father who was killed in a car wreck. And then Dr. Howard was the third one. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, um, I really liked him too. He was the vet. He was very good to me.  
Speaker 0    00:30:39    And then Helen, uh, grew up with him as well? Yes.  
Speaker 1    00:30:44    Oh, yes. Helen and Mike. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mike was the brother. Those three were very close. The children were close mm-hmm <affirmative>. Right at, to toward the end. I mean, Mike just would not face the fact that Tommy was dying. He just wouldn't face it. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:31:01    <affirmative>. How did he die? Tommy,  
Speaker 1    00:31:02    Tommy died of, uh, lung cancer. And Mike dropped dead of a heart attack after that. And so  
Speaker 0    00:31:12    Short shortly after.  
Speaker 1    00:31:13    Oh, about five years. And Helen is the last, and she's, she's my younger sister-in-law.  
Speaker 0    00:31:23    She's very Sprightly <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:31:24    Very sprightly. She does a world of good in the community.  
Speaker 0    00:31:28    She sure does. She still plays tennis, and I know  
Speaker 1    00:31:30    It. Oh, she, and she's just, I was with her yesterday. She's just so enthusiastic. Yeah. And she doesn't just talk it, she does it.  
Speaker 0    00:31:42    And welcoming. I mean,  
Speaker 1    00:31:43    Yes. Very welcoming.  
Speaker 0    00:31:45    You know, I've only been here 20 years, but, you know, everybody was so welcoming when we first came here across the generations. Yes. And it wasn't just, you know, it was people my own age with kids, the age of my kids, but also older people here. The older people really like to see people move here and love it, and Yes. And take part in the community.  
Speaker 1    00:32:07    It's true. It, it's very special. This, this area here. And when I was in the, as I said, I was involved with the church just because it's where I started. Um, the women of the Mary Dean Neville Gill, which was the, at the church, asked me if I would go on the vestry. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And women didn't go on the vestry, but they asked if I would try to run for the vestry, so there'd be a woman. And so I said, yes. But one of the stipulations that when I was elected was that when the men, after the meeting, when the men went into the living room at the different houses and had their drinks, I would excuse myself, I, so there were rules, right?  
Speaker 0    00:32:59    <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:32:59    And I went on the vestry twice, and it never changed.  
Speaker 0    00:33:03    Oh. Has it changed now? 'cause there are women on the, the  
Speaker 1    00:33:06    Vestry. Yeah. I don't know whether they have drinks or not <laugh>, but at my, when I was there, that was the stipulation from the ladies. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. The men, they asked me. But that was, that was the rule.  
Speaker 0    00:33:19    Huh?  
Speaker 1    00:33:22    It was 19, yeah. 1960s, seventies. Yeah. The  
Speaker 0    00:33:29    Women, it was the women that didn't want you socializing with their,  
Speaker 1    00:33:33    They just felt that it was, had nothing to do with the fact they were their husbands. It was just not, um, seemly, I guess  
Speaker 0    00:33:42    <laugh> were there a lot more, um, social mores like that here than there are now?  
Speaker 1    00:33:52    I don't, I wasn't, I wasn't aware of, I've always been aware of that one because I think it's so colorful. Right. You know, not that it's, I didn't feel like I was denied. That's I don't drink. Right. But I didn't feel that I was denied. It was just, it's, it is just a colorful part of the community. <laugh>,  
Speaker 0    00:34:13    <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:34:16    And the church. You know, it was just, it was just one of those, those things. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:34:24    How often would you go back to New Mexico when the,  
Speaker 1    00:34:27    Usually, um, always in the summer children. Um, but a lot of times during the year, I would go back, I went back for Christmas one time, but it was hard to leave Virginia. You know, it was really hard to leave Virginia and go back when I couldn't stay. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I didn't, I was torn between both. Right. Virginia and New Mexico. Right. When I got to New Mexico, I was just reborn practically, but then I would have to leave it. Right. And then I'd go to Virginia, and then I wouldn't wanna leave Virginia. And I think with Virginia, it was mostly Tommy's family and my friends that held me here. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:35:16    And then your own children.  
Speaker 1    00:35:17    Yes.  
Speaker 0    00:35:18    And their friends and  
Speaker 1    00:35:20    Yes. And their friends too. You know, because as you said, you had things with your children's friends, and that was just part of the norm. Right. It was just family picnics and family parties and, you know, we, we just brought all generational is what you said, and that's true. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:35:40    When you, um, did you use the horses mainly to do the cattle business? Or did you do other things with horses? Mostly  
Speaker 1    00:35:47    The cattle business. Right. Tommy had quit hunting years before he tell me that. The reason was he looked around the field and there were, uh, mostly women, girls, and he no boys. They weren't hunting at the time. That's what he told me anyway. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I think a lot of it was he was away at school.  
Speaker 0    00:36:06    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:36:07    And, uh, didn't have the opportunity like he did when he lived in Warrenton. Um, I'm still trying to think of where their farm was in Warrenton. Uh, that'll come to me. But  
Speaker 0    00:36:23    The before Meadowville mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    00:36:24    <affirmative>. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I just can't where on my head. Uh, anyway, uh, once he went away to school. Yeah. That's, you know, and, uh, he was the only one, I think that hunted Helen. Well, Helen showed a lot. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mike didn't, he was in the cattle business, but, um, in Tennessee. So there, you know, there it was a farming family too. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And probably did her, my mother-in-law. She did, um, worked with children with the horses and pony club and dogs. She had showed dogs. It was just animals and children. And  
Speaker 0    00:37:15    It was an outdoor sporting. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Life kind of family. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:37:19    Very special. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:37:22    And did she have, um, you say she showed dogs. Did she have a special breed  
Speaker 1    00:37:27    Corgis? Mm. Looked like a fox. And she looked like a  
Speaker 0    00:37:31    Fox. Did she, <laugh>?  
Speaker 1    00:37:34    I used to say all the time. She was so close to them that she was starting to look more and more like a fox. Um, and then the corgis, of course are, and I'm waiting to try to find another one when died last year. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. My last one. But, um, she gave the children each corgis, and Stormy had a female, and she went to stay with her grandmother when the bitch, we, and it was just, you know, she brought the children in, involved in it. And again, it's just family involvement  
Speaker 0    00:38:09    That's really special for them. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. My son, um, Kathy asked him over when the dog was, you know, young, and he got a puppy and his favorite dog ever, because he knew the mother. And  
Speaker 1    00:38:24    Yeah. It's just, it is, it's special. It is in Round Deer.  
Speaker 0    00:38:30    It's special to  
Speaker 1    00:38:31    Be able, I'm sure it happens someplace else's. But, uh, and on the ranch for us, uh, you know, I watched Calves being born and MAs bowling and things like that, but they belonged to the Ranch Poll, always made sure that the children had a claim to what they worked for mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know mm-hmm <affirmative>. If they, if she took care of that, uh, dog of hers. And then she had the whelping, she, you know, she was part of the business as far as Polly was concerned. Did  
Speaker 0    00:39:08    She show the dogs or just breed them?  
Speaker 1    00:39:11    Polly showed,  
Speaker 0    00:39:13    She showed,  
Speaker 1    00:39:14    She showed at Madison Square Garden, uh, Canada, Florida.  
Speaker 0    00:39:19    So she traveled all around with these dogs mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:39:22    Before I, before I was married. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Is what I, I just  
Speaker 0    00:39:27    Knew. So when Tommy was growing up, Uhhuh, <affirmative>,  
Speaker 1    00:39:29    Because, you know, they were all away at school, and so Polly would Yeah. But her, her dogs were very special to her. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she did, they did. They looked like a fox. And she did too. <laugh>. Gosh. She was special. So  
Speaker 0    00:39:48    Now, did she, um, when she came over to live at Air Shire,  
Speaker 1    00:39:54    She was sick.  
Speaker 0    00:39:55    She was  
Speaker 1    00:39:56    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:39:57    But she wanted,  
Speaker 1    00:39:58    And she and Fritz, our third husband, had divorced. And so she moved into one end of the big house. And, um, I took care of her.  
Speaker 0    00:40:13    That must've been nice for her to come closer.  
Speaker 1    00:40:15    Yeah. I think. I think so, but yes. Um, but it wasn't exactly the way she thought it was gonna be because the children were older in a way. Some married, some, you know, it wasn't exactly like the way she'd grown up at mm-hmm <affirmative>. Asure. And she was sick. She had cancer. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But when my children were there, they, they and Helen's children, girls, they were always upstairs and seeing, you know, going through albums and things with her and all that. So it wasn't, it wasn't loneliness. Right. It was just not quite the way she figured it.  
Speaker 0    00:40:59    Right. Because she wasn't as mobile as she wanted to be. Right. But she was there with all of you. Yes. Which must have been a Yes. Wonderful.  
Speaker 1    00:41:07    Yeah. I was  
Speaker 0    00:41:08    Way to spend a year  
Speaker 1    00:41:09    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:41:10    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. When did you, um, you built this house?  
Speaker 1    00:41:15    Yes. Tommy owned this piece of property. And, um, it joins Air Shere. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But he owned this himself. Um, and we started planning the building, the children, and Tommy and I would cut out pictures out of magazines of rooms and driveways and all that sort of thing. And we found this spot without taking down trees. And he and I, um, went to Clare's graduation in Mobile. Can't remember which year, but when we came back, it was probably in 95. I, we knew the cancer was coming back. And he and I would come every day and clean these woods up, take the IV off the trees, and he'd pick up the limbs or cut off small limbs. And he worked it until we built that little cottage over there. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. That was his office. He never got to see this house, but it has his mark on it. <affirmative>, because he had pictures of way that he planned things.  
Speaker 0    00:42:29    Right. Stormy still does that. Yes. She's a big planner. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Earmarks books. And  
Speaker 1    00:42:35    I know, I  
Speaker 0    00:42:36    Know. Shares her files with people  
Speaker 1    00:42:37    And That's true. And, uh, Tommy always promised me that because of my, we had a car accident before we were married, and my ankle is really bad, and, uh, so I can't walk as well and climb stairs. So he always promised that in this house, we would have a room right off the kitchen, and I wouldn't have to go up and down the stairs or down the halls and all that. And what he didn't figure out was, I can hear everything that goes on and is said in this room, <laugh>. He never had one thing he could get away with. He never figured it out that I, you know, I was seventh of listening  
Speaker 0    00:43:18    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    00:43:20    So, um, you knew  
Speaker 0    00:43:21    Everything that was  
Speaker 1    00:43:22    Going on. I know everything that's going on. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:43:25    So the kids didn't live in this house either?  
Speaker 1    00:43:28    No.  
Speaker 0    00:43:28    Mm-hmm. It was  
Speaker 1    00:43:30    No yours. When Tommy got sick, and we sold Aer when he was the sickest, I rented Mrs. Demi's house in Middleburg. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, for us to, and the children were, Clayburn was the still in school his last year. Stormy was in New York, and Billy was traveling a lot. He was in Germany a lot. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Of business. So, um, they would just come and visit it. Right. But that's where Tommy and I lived for the last year. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:44:04    <affirmative>. And when you say he owned this property, was Asure was separate. That was a family operation?  
Speaker 1    00:44:11    That was a family. Uhhuh <affirmative>. It was a family. It came from Aunt Helen to Tommy's mother. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then when she died, came to Tommy. And, um, it was just a matter of the different stocks. They just issued it. Right. They bought each other out, like families do.  
Speaker 0    00:44:30    Right. Yes, of course.  
Speaker 1    00:44:32    So he ended up owning the, the whole thing and all the debt. That's what that killed us, was the debt.  
Speaker 0    00:44:40    Right. And was that because of the, the cattle business changed, or the land?  
Speaker 1    00:44:46    A lot of it was that, um, um, the price of land is taxes. Uh, I could, I just watched the taxes going up, up, up, and Yes. With cattle prices going down, down, down. Right. And we couldn't, we couldn't balance it out. <affirmative>. And we weren't the only ones.  
Speaker 0    00:45:11    I was just gonna say, that must have changed the way of life around here quite a bit. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yes. When did the taxes, when did they start moving the taxes?  
Speaker 1    00:45:22    Well, I'm trying to think. When Polly died. Um, I said to to, if I could remember when she died, and Helen died in 81, and Polly died in, I can't remember, but I, one thing I remember saying to Tommy, we were sitting out on the porch after his mother died. And I said, don't you just love re And he said, I can't afford to, I'm the one that's gonna lose it. And that was true. And it was due to the way life was changing the cost of things. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, yes. The cattle business, uh, was not very lucrative at the time. People were getting into horses and stock por portfolios and things like that. Right,  
Speaker 0    00:46:20    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:46:21    And we were sticking to the way of life that we had known and, um, just didn't have the money to expand. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:46:31    Because you were making money from your operation, putting it back into your operation. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I think it seems to me a lot of people that came out and bought big places had money already. Right. They were mm-hmm <affirmative>. Investing resources they already had. That's right. As opposed to counting on the property to, um, continue itself. That's  
Speaker 1    00:46:55    Right. That's right. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And the old, old Farms just read about another one in Kentucky. The old, old Farms had a hard time adapting mm-hmm <affirmative>. To, um, it's a new way of making the ends meet. Right. Um, if that makes sense. I mean, it, it was a learning situation that, that the older generation couldn't learn. They just couldn't adapt. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:47:28    You mean they had to do more things.  
Speaker 1    00:47:30    You have to do more things, invest, investing. Right. Some of your livelihood, taking a gamble, taking a chance, sell off a piece Right. Before the easements went in, you know, sell off a piece of property, they didn't want to give up anything. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. They just couldn't adapt. It's easy the older. The older. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:47:51    But SRE was never carved up like that?  
Speaker 1    00:47:54    No, no. Uh, it was looked at to build a golf course and put houses around it and all that. And we just, all just, you know, it was proposed to us Right. To save it. And it just, we couldn't, we couldn't stand the thought of it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So we didn't adapt. And the, my sons really worked for it because they were progressive and Billy was in DC and he felt very strongly that we should try it and save the rest of the farm. But we just couldn't, we weren't able to figure out how to Right. Do it.  
Speaker 0    00:48:38    Was it something that either of you wanted to do even  
Speaker 1    00:48:41    No, Tommy and I really didn't mm-hmm <affirmative>. But it's just comes down to the matter of hate change. You know, you know, you don't have to, but you just hate doing. So you put it off and you put it off, and pretty soon you dug your hole deeper. Right. That's what happened. It was just the way of the times.  
Speaker 0    00:49:05    Was Upperville mostly big farms when you first came?  
Speaker 1    00:49:10    Pretty much. So.  
Speaker 0    00:49:11    And how, how, how has it changed? Um, are there less big farms now? Have there been more?  
Speaker 1    00:49:20    I think there, well, once Melons went and Newstead, um,  
Speaker 0    00:49:29    Is Asure still intact?  
Speaker 1    00:49:31    Re's still intact. Um, but there, I think there's seven farms around me that are for sale. Car, OME, Claremont, stead, stone. Um,  
Speaker 0    00:49:45    Are they keeping Sted intact?  
Speaker 1    00:49:48    I'm not sure. I'm not sure.  
Speaker 0    00:49:51    Now. A lot of times now they have to do that because of easement. Was Asure put into easement. We  
Speaker 1    00:49:56    Put it in, we were one of the first to put into agricultural easement. And, um, that was just keeping it in at, we were one of the first to do that. We never went on beyond that, which we have done now with all this. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. This whole block upperville in this, this corner is protected. Um, the Walford's did it. We did it. Um, my neighbor's done it. Green Garden where Stormy lifts, that's Jay did it. Right. That was really concentrated and, um, planned to save the, the land. Whereas when we did it with Asure, that was just a, a sort of a thought process that it was not developed. But we, we put it in agricultural easement. The  
Speaker 0    00:50:47    Agricultural easement allows you to have a, a special tax rate,  
Speaker 1    00:50:52    Land use. You have to, for land use. To use land use. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I've always been in land use. Um, it was mainly to stay in the agricultural, um, block. And we, you could get the other farms around us to join us. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We could have been a solid block, but we, they were suspicious of it. Right. Why the farms were suspicious of it. Well, I just think that, um, it meant government stepping in, maybe mm-hmm <affirmative>. I don't know. I don't know. That might not be right. Lydia, uh, Tommy didn't have any, never even said anything about government bothering him, being involved. He just Right. Felt that he do what he could to save the farm for the children, uh, for the next generation. But I think other people maybe were a little more astute. Right. Um, more understood where the government was going and they were suspicious of it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Tommy was not a suspicious man.  
Speaker 2    00:52:05    <laugh>,  
Speaker 1    00:52:06    He worked hard. Even though he was sick, he worked hard. We kept our fences up. I mowed uc five days. Yeah. Uh, a week on, on air shirt. It looked lovely. But the house, the buildings were falling down.  
Speaker 2    00:52:24    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. It's  
Speaker 1    00:52:25    A lot of upkeep. You know, the porches were falling off and  
Speaker 0    00:52:28    It's a lot of upkeep.  
Speaker 1    00:52:29    Yeah. It really was. But the, the land, we kept the land clean and as neat as we could.  
Speaker 0    00:52:38    What did you mow on the John Deere?  
Speaker 1    00:52:40    I had a John Deere. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, uh, sometimes I'd and Tommy had a John Deere and sometimes he would sort of walk around and mope a little bit and I'd say, go get on your tractor. Don't go in your office. Get outta your tractor. And he'd get on that tractor. And it was just like night and day, you know?  
Speaker 0    00:53:01    'cause the land was mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    00:53:03    <affirmative>. The land was very important. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. To us both. So I'm glad it's still intact, but I've not been back.  
Speaker 0    00:53:11    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:53:13    Not been back.  
Speaker 0    00:53:14    Well, sometimes that's better to remember things.  
Speaker 1    00:53:17    But, you know, I love coming home. I love coming home to asu. I've said many times, either it didn't matter whether it was from the grocery store or from New Mexico. I love that drive coming back and taking this road into Air  
Speaker 0    00:53:33    Center. That's how I feel about going to my house. And it's something about the mountains, the cradle of the mountains that you see  
Speaker 1    00:53:41    That might be mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:53:43    <affirmative>. It's open, but it's protected and just so beautiful.  
Speaker 1    00:53:48    It is. And I've lately been doing some different doctor's appointments and just locally in down route, 50th Stone Springs Hospital, Ville. Oh. Round Hill's changing all those houses going in. But as soon as you break out of that and you get closer to this road mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know, it opens up and you just feel like you can breathe. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:54:15    Is this, uh, Faki County or Loudoun County? Loudoun  
Speaker 1    00:54:18    Loud. Right. Third of Mile and, uh, lamb.  
Speaker 0    00:54:21    Yeah. I think we, when we lived in Willville Road, we were the, like the last, we got never any service. Never any plowing. Right. Electric. That's why go out and be out for weeks.  
Speaker 1    00:54:34    That's why you were cross country skiing from the car to the groceries. Yeah. Yeah. They wouldn't go. You. Well, you can see my road, Gail Wofford calls all the time about that road. She can get them to at least answer the phone. Right. But I mean, they've got a hole down at their house. And then ours is just, we try to keep it cleared out. But they came and worked just a little bit on the Melville corner the other day, period. Right. That's 'cause the police cars stopped there. <laugh>,  
Speaker 0    00:55:07    They're not doing a very good job at taking care of the dirt roads. Yeah. They're  
Speaker 1    00:55:10    Not. And you know, a number of years ago we went to fight, uh, the state about re tearing down these bridges and widening them. These bridges were put in Civil War bridges. Yeah. And General Buchanan built the last one down there. And we won. Stopped them. And then they stopped coming to do the roads. And we figured that it was a trade off with them. They won't let us do, we have money to do the bridges and we wouldn't let 'em do it. So they just took the money and went somewhere else and they didn't, they're paying back, pay back <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:55:51    Well, at least no one's speeding on your road. <laugh>. Well,  
Speaker 1    00:55:53    This is true. They speed right to that corner there. But they don't do it here.  
Speaker 0    00:55:58    Right. You don't as many tourists. I mean Well, that's  
Speaker 1    00:56:01    True. And Tommy used to say all the time, I don't want it paved. I don't want it cleaned up. 'cause they bring their trash from Winchester and throw their McDonald trash out of the road. If, if they do that, don't, don't clean up the roads. We don't want 'em coming on the roads. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he was Right. You know, we used to clean the road all the time. The Pave Road on Air Search Road, and that was trash. Right. But we don't have trash as much. All of us pick it up. You drive it along and you see it, you know, you pick up a, um, can or something, but it's not like it is on a highway. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:56:43    Had the cattle business, I I imagine has changed quite a bit too.  
Speaker 1    00:56:46    It has. And in New Mexico it's really, um, interesting because it bothers me in many ways. I'm the oldest stockholder on the thing, but I watched it. The oil and gas companies come in and it's unbelievable. We make more money selling the oil and gas people water for their fracking than we do on selling our cattle. And we have the land to sell to graze our cattle, and we do well with it. But the, the difference and the prices of oil and gas and the catalyst got like this,  
Speaker 0    00:57:24    Which is amazing because we really need cattle.  
Speaker 1    00:57:27    I know it, but it,  
Speaker 0    00:57:29    The cattle is coming from other places.  
Speaker 1    00:57:32    Well, the oil was coming from other places too. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. It's a matter of, uh, competition with the oil and gas. And of course I don't approve of the fracking, but it goes hand in hand. So I don't know.  
Speaker 0    00:57:44    Right. But I feel like there's gonna be more regulation on that.  
Speaker 1    00:57:47    There will be. There will be. But the, the government is so proud of the fact that it says we're the leading oil producers in the world. It's not so, but I won't get into that <laugh>. But, um, that is what they're driving for. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So the cattle industry is over. Cattle industry's been way off for quite, it's been concerning us, but it's picking up a little bit. But one day soon on my ranch, my family ranch, um, there won't be land. There'll just more oil rigs. Um, more gas lines be more and more right there. There's so many wrecks on those roads now. These big trucks hit little trucks and Right. It's hard getting to the ranch drop turnoff, which is 60 miles from town.  
Speaker 0    00:58:45    And what town is it?  
Speaker 1    00:58:46    Carlsbad.  
Speaker 0    00:58:47    Carlsbad. So that's very southern Uhhuh  
Speaker 1    00:58:49    <affirmative>, New Mexico Southeastern part of, but the, I didn't mean to get off off on that, but it's, it's just a way of life that, you know, it depends on what you're the most interested in and what you can, uh, invest in. Right.  
Speaker 0    00:59:07    When do you think that it really started to change here? That became more difficult?  
Speaker 1    00:59:17    Um,  
Speaker 1    00:59:21    Tommy died in nine six. We started seeing it. We started seeing it, um, before Polly died. And a lot of that was, um, see they were, they were, Bristol Myers was their, their background with their money. And they sold off the, the people in DC sold off their stock thinking they'd make a bill killing and then buy back more. And it didn't work that way, which happens a lot. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, that's what started changing for us. But people started selling off small pieces of land. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Like this was owned by Car Toman long time ago. Right.  
Speaker 0    01:00:08    Oh, down  
Speaker 1    01:00:09    Here. And before, before the Thompsons did, owned it. And he sold this off, and that's how Tommy got it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know, a little piece here and a little piece there. Didn't hurt the big farm. It just, you know, maybe cushion gave him a cushion. And then if you did it once and you do it another time. Right. And the next thing you know, you, you need to do it.  
Speaker 0    01:00:33    And how much property is this here?  
Speaker 1    01:00:36    This is 71 acres and Tommy sold 10. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. See, he, he'd already sold 10 off of this, which is right down at the bottom. But I own 71 acres and I'd lease it to Jerry Crenshaw with his cattle. And that's how I get my land use and get it cut in the right in the tax thing. But Loudoun County taxes, as you well know, are higher than er.  
Speaker 0    01:01:02    That's partly why we moved. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:01:05    So I'm, I'm stuck with that. 'cause I'm in Loudoun. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    01:01:10    Yeah. The line's funny here.  
Speaker 1    01:01:12    I know it, it's, yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:01:14    Kind of  
Speaker 1    01:01:15    Zigzag.  
Speaker 0    01:01:16    Not sure it would make sense if it was Route 50, but,  
Speaker 1    01:01:19    Nope. Oh, no. That would make too much sense. <laugh>. That would be too easy. Too easy.  
Speaker 0    01:01:27    When you would visit other people on their farms, would you, um, go back and forth on ponies and horses? And  
Speaker 1    01:01:35    I didn't, but, um, and my children weren't begging horses. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But the children of the plats into buses rode to air on their horse ponies. Well, so did Virginia. So did their mothers, you know, they were, they were so funny that Virginia McCarty, she would ride over and Lucy Brown would come over. And when she was little, um, yeah. The, you know, it was just, and they had grown up as children coming in the summertime to Ahire, because the de Bus men were managers. Oh, I see. For the, the general years before. And Tommy took over the management from Mr. Hunter debuts. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So you see the families were really pretty without being wedded to each other. Were intermingling. Right. In business.  
Speaker 0    01:02:28    Were there as many people that came out from DC for the, um, for the country living at the time?  
Speaker 1    01:02:36    No. No. Not that I remember. Uh, we didn't have weekenders.  
Speaker 0    01:02:45    Right.  
Speaker 1    01:02:46    Not, not, not that I remember at all.  
Speaker 0    01:02:49    Well, the Kennedys,  
Speaker 1    01:02:51    Well, of course that, that might've started at some, maybe that started at some, do you think, I mean,  
Speaker 0    01:02:57    That's an interesting, that's an interesting question because she, she came out 'cause she was used to the horses mm-hmm <affirmative>. And wanted to have that experience for herself and her children. Right. Right. Did you know them?  
Speaker 1    01:03:15    Um, I saw them in town. You know, you sort of, but they were always guarded. I was thinking of one thing was that, um, when I was on the vestry, one of the times Mom was here from New Mexico and we were taking the children to Sunday school, and she was gonna come in church with me. But when I pulled up, I had to jump out and have her park the car because the Secret Service was all out in the courtyard because Reagan was there. They'd forgotten to tell the vestry. And so I was saying, I, I've gotta get through to the church. I'm on Vesty duty. And then I usually have phones go like this, Vesty Vesty, <laugh>  
Speaker 0    01:04:00    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:04:01    And I was so undo by the time I got inside, I wouldn't stay on the side that the Mr. Reagan was <laugh> Vesty Vesty. And they all had their black coats, you know, and their, all that stuff. It was so, they forgot to tell us what was going on.  
Speaker 0    01:04:17    When was the church built? That was, it was, uh, all complete by the time you came mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    01:04:23    <affirmative>. But we didn't, um, we didn't have the Sunday school. That's why I started teaching two of my children at Sunday school. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, so it was just a, a starting, sir. We had the beautiful building and all, but we didn't have, we didn't have, I used to think how many people, we had a church, 50 people would show up or something, you know. Um, and I, when I felt, when I really thought about it, I said to the vest and to the rector, if you can get the children to come to the church, to the services, uh, have a Jim carna, you know, day. Right. Something the parents will come. And eventually a lot of people worked on that, you know mm-hmm <affirmative>. Because it got to be fun to put on these, these shows and things that we did at the church.  
Speaker 0    01:05:27    Well, it was a way for everybody to be together. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:05:29    It was, you know, we used to have a blacksmith in the parking lot there in the front. Really? On the Saturday. Yes. And you would teach people how to, what he did with smithing and, you know, you know, and I think it was, um, Bob Clark from Upperville was the one that did it. He was the, the farrier. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know it was a community thing and he, he was probably a Baptist. He, he wasn't <inaudible>, but it just all came together. And, you know, Helen does a lot of this with churches combining and joining all our churches in the area. That again, is something that I think is really special. You unique, you know, and the clown does that,  
Speaker 0    01:06:14    Right?  
Speaker 1    01:06:14    Yeah. I think that's good. A lot  
Speaker 0    01:06:16    Of the food pantry and mm-hmm <affirmative>. Take it here and we all take it there. And,  
Speaker 1    01:06:20    And that, that's continuing from the past. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know. Yeah. They're a special community.  
Speaker 0    01:06:29    Well, I would, you know, I've been going to Trinity, I guess 20 years. And one of the differences, I think now, like, my kids are older, I go to the earlier service mm-hmm <affirmative>. Which is not as many people. Um, but it seems to me that membership has been fairly steady.  
Speaker 1    01:06:54    I think so  
Speaker 0    01:06:55    The past 20 years. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. That people, it, it's not always the same people, but in terms of numbers that maybe you lose some, you gain some. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:07:07    Tommy started the eight o'clock service.  
Speaker 0    01:07:09    Did he really?  
Speaker 1    01:07:10    Because he said, um, he had to get out and plow Bush Hog. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he then, oh, then secretly he would say, and they don't pass the plate.  
Speaker 0    01:07:23    They do now. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:07:25    <laugh>, they put the little chair in the middle of the step there. You know, the step. That was the first sign. And then the, the plates were there. You didn't know Dick Pierce?  
Speaker 0    01:07:36    I did not. Oh.  
Speaker 1    01:07:37    He was just great.  
Speaker 0    01:07:39    And how long? That was a, he was a very long tenure.  
Speaker 1    01:07:45    I can't remember a time like that. But he, he was, he was, they were always controversial. Uh, every rector is a controversial person.  
Speaker 0    01:07:55    Well, anything new is controversial. <laugh>. Yes.  
Speaker 1    01:07:57    But he was really, he really pulled, pulled this church.  
Speaker 0    01:08:02    And Was he here when you got arrived?  
Speaker 1    01:08:04    No, I was on the, on the, uh, search committee. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. For him. Um, and I was on the vestry at the time. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, but he, he just clicked with the children again, you know, bring the children. Right. You know, bring the parents. Tommy was in the hospital for something else not as cancer. And it was, Clayburn was being confirmed and  
Speaker 1    01:08:32    I could, I got Clayburn home from church, but the hospital told me I had to come right away to the hospital in Leesburg. And I didn't wanna leave Clayborn by himself. The other two were off in school. And I'm trying to tell Clarin to come outta this tree. He had climbed a tree and he said he wasn't coming down. Tell Daddy came home from the hospital. We go, come down and I'm begging him to come down and down the road, <inaudible> Road, I see this little dune buggy, not a dune buggy, but a little car. And it appeared and he said, I thought maybe you needed me. And I said, would you get this little boy out of this tree? I've gotta go to the hospital. He climbed the tree. Clare wrote a story about this and they did it for Dick Pier's funeral. He climbed the tree and sat up there with Clare to talk him out of that tree. And he took him to Gil Walford to stay while I was down. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know. So that was another little tidbit. Right.  
Speaker 2    01:09:34    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:09:35    That's amazing. No, I didn't know him.  
Speaker 1    01:09:37    He was very special. Very special.  
Speaker 0    01:09:41    Was it mostly long-term, uh, leadership at the church?  
Speaker 1    01:09:50    Uh, let's see. I came, I can't remember the first man that was here because when I was at New Bride, 'cause he didn't stay very long, but he was single. I know that the second man's name was Cox, I think Inc.  
Speaker 0    01:10:08    Well, there's a Cox Hall. So,  
Speaker 1    01:10:10    And he said to me, yes, Cox Hall. And he said to me one time when I first met him or something, oh God, I can't remember that either. It was so funny. 'cause he was a bachelor. I can't remember Lydia. It was just, he said, just think of me as a, didn't say eunuch <laugh>, but something close to that  
Speaker 2    01:10:37    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:10:39    It was something close it. Like I didn't stick that water out. Yeah. It wasn't, it was like, I knew broad and you know, and I was sort of  
Speaker 2    01:10:46    Saying,  
Speaker 1    01:10:46    What's this man? It was something like, I, something he said like that he drank a lot. <laugh>. I found that, I found that out. <laugh>. I found that out. And then, so he was, he didn't last too long.  
Speaker 1    01:11:04    And then, um, I don't know whether he baptized Billy or not, but he was gone right after that. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I guess, you know why <laugh>, the older generation did not appreciate his preferences, I guess, which I didn't understand at the time. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then we had sh Ryan and it was so funny. The other day I went into the Oyster bar to have lunch. Han Ryan, who was here in our rector for quite a while. I walk in and I hear this laugh, he's dead now. But I heard this laugh. And I turned around and looked at his wife, who is 94 years old, Jane Ryan. And she and her two daughters were there having lunch. And Are they still in the area? She lives over in Winchester. I think she's might be at Westminster. Oh yeah. One daughter's here and the other daughter's in New York. Um, and there are two other children.  
Speaker 1    01:12:05    But that laugh, I knew it is the throat sort of laugh. She's 94, I think she's 94 or 98. Anyway, I went over and I spoke to her and all that and I said, well, I just had my 80th birthday. And she said, well, I'm nine four, whatever. And she said, um, I hope you make it. And I said, well wait for me. And she said, ah, I've known I really like her. She's from, uh, Rhode Island. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then we used to go to Rhode Island a lot in the summers. Times where the Stokes has had a place, um, that chuckle. So that was one. And then, and then Dick Bear came. Okay. And here and I stayed. Yeah. I think the problem now that I'm concerned about the church, 'cause I'm not going, and there are quite a few of us that used to go at eight o'clock all the time, have stopped going.  
Speaker 1    01:12:58    I think a lot of it is we can't come to an agreement of what kind of a per parish priest we need. Who will, who will help us. It's gotten bigger. That's understandable. So that doesn't bother me. But something to give us the basis that we used to have mm-hmm <affirmative>. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Because we keep getting these retirees. And Martin, I've known Martin, you know, and Mr. Miller, I think he was well liked with some, some were, there's always controversy, but you know, they're ready for retirement. Right. And I've known 'em all. And what one of the things that really upset us, uh, before that was that the confirmation classes just disappeared. I mean, Peter Hood had to be confirmed after school, uh, at eighth grade, you know, that my children all went after school to classes. Right. And then the bishop came, and then we confirmed Peter and Lewis, you know, Anson, uh, Kate Fanning's daughter had to do it after school. I don't even think they know what they learned. Right. Because there just wasn't an interest. There isn't an interest. The same thing's happening now with, with the next eighth grade class.  
Speaker 0    01:14:26    Well, last year Ed Miller was here and they had five kids. Cade was Kate among them. And um, but he didn't confirm them. They did classes on Sundays, but only like four of them. It was mm-hmm <affirmative>. It was quick because he wanted the bishop to confirm them. So when the bishop was here last spring, they were confirmed.  
Speaker 1    01:14:53    And that was the year between Peter and mm-hmm <affirmative>. And Theo now.  
Speaker 0    01:14:56    Right.  
Speaker 1    01:14:58    And like with Dick Stokes, who Ellen's trying to get the funeral, decided she has to deal with Martin who I like. But he's retiring and he only here on weekends. Right. And it's hard for her to, so it, she tried it for the 25th, but this Saturday. But, so it's gonna have to be February.  
Speaker 0    01:15:25    That's a waiting quite a while. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:15:28    And I'll be gone. Right. Not that that's important, but I  
Speaker 0    01:15:32    Am a good friend. And what's the relation of Dick Stokes too?  
Speaker 1    01:15:35    Nothing.  
Speaker 0    01:15:35    Oh. Nothing.  
Speaker 1    01:15:36    Nothing Just confuses the issue. Right. <laugh>?  
Speaker 0    01:15:42    I didn't think so,  
Speaker 1    01:15:42    But told, we used to say all the time, you make sure everybody knows I'm not related to Dick Stove <laugh>. I said, he says the same thing about you, Tommy. You make sure I'm not related to Tommy. So don't want your reputation attached to mine.  
Speaker 0    01:15:57    So did you play tennis? Did you go to the tennis club when it was first started? Uhhuh. <affirmative>. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:16:03    And Morgan Dennis called us the mullets. And mullets are just trash fish  
Speaker 0    01:16:09    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:16:11    So it was Helen and they and Paige Glascock and Gail and Molly Spencer. And we were the mullets. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Trash fish.  
Speaker 0    01:16:22    And you had a regular tennis game. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:16:24    We had a regular tennis game. And uh,  
Speaker 0    01:16:27    What year was the tennis club started? I should know that. I don't  
Speaker 1    01:16:30    Know. I don't remember the years. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    01:16:32    It was in the sixties though.  
Speaker 1    01:16:34    Well, I think so.  
Speaker 0    01:16:35    I wanna say, because I think they just had, yeah, because they just had the 50th anniversary. This in 19, so it must have been 69  
Speaker 1    01:16:43    Probably. So you're close. You're better than I am. <laugh>. I'm not, I'm not even close. Um, but yeah, we joined as soon as the children, uh, wanted swim. Right. No swim pool wasn't put in first. As soon as they wanted to play tennis or Right. Act around, you know, and have a lesson or something. You wanted your children to sort of mix with others after school or something like that. Right. Um, that's when we joined. And then when they all went away to school, I, um, got out of it and then I decided I would go back in for business purposes about 10 years ago, I guess. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    01:17:31    For business purposes. Well,  
Speaker 1    01:17:32    Like when I had people coming that to do business, there was no place really to, to  
Speaker 0    01:17:38    Have a lunch.  
Speaker 1    01:17:38    Yeah. To take them to lunch. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    01:17:40    <affirmative>. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    01:17:40    <affirmative>. That's what I did.  
Speaker 0    01:17:42    Are you still involved with the Cattle Cattle Association?  
Speaker 1    01:17:46    No, I, I retired from that. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And not I am for my ranch in New Mexico. Yeah. But, uh, the Virginia one, no, I finally got out of it about two years ago. Right.  
Speaker 0    01:17:59    But you,  
Speaker 1    01:17:59    I'm 80 years old.  
Speaker 0    01:18:02    But you were working with them for  
Speaker 1    01:18:05    Well, we just, because we were members. Right. It was a membership thing. You'd have membership drives or something like that. Right. But actually I didn't, Tommy was president one time, but I wasn't interested in, in being, I'm not interested in being in that sort of thing.  
Speaker 0    01:18:23    Right. But what  
Speaker 1    01:18:25    The bigger, the bigger, you know, when you I like four H things. Yes. But when it gets into, you know, you'd have to go to the big meetings and then you have the big dinners and I don't know, I would go to NCA meetings 'cause my father was on the board mm-hmm <affirmative>. But, um, I just didn't wanna be involved  
Speaker 0    01:18:52    Right.  
Speaker 1    01:18:52    In it.  
Speaker 0    01:18:54    But it's mostly for lobbying and social purposes. Mm, yes. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. For mm-hmm <affirmative>. Group to group together your interests so that  
Speaker 1    01:19:01    Yes. And I could vote and I would vote as a member of the national or Virginia, but it gotta the point where I really didn't know what I was voting for. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    01:19:11    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:19:12    I didn't understand that, you know, there was such a split. There's a real split now. Right. Sort of, um, I wouldn't even be able to explain it,  
Speaker 0    01:19:21    But Bob's there was very involved too. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yes.  
Speaker 1    01:19:25    He was very involved. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He's very aware of what goes on. Yeah. And he talks about when I ask a question,  
Speaker 0    01:19:32    <laugh>. Well that's,  
Speaker 1    01:19:34    So I learned I have my business that way. Right,  
Speaker 0    01:19:39    Right. Yeah. What else? What are we missing? We talked about the tennis club, the church. Were there any other association? Hill School?  
Speaker 1    01:19:51    Yes. I was on the board of Hill School. You  
Speaker 0    01:19:52    Were at the board of the Hill School when your kids were there or afterwards?  
Speaker 1    01:19:58    Uh, when they were there. And I was with, um, doc, staffer was president one time of the parents, one that I was on with him or else I was on the board and worked with him. But it was after Nixon's, uh, John Dean had gone to school with Doc. Is that right? And he arranged to have John Dean come to the community center to speak on behalf of, of Hill School. And  
Speaker 0    01:20:35    I think it was Ms. Morris. How'd that  
Speaker 1    01:20:36    Go over? Or something did not go over. Did not go over at all. And he had money had come in for it and Doc had stuck his head out, no neck out for all this. Right. And I was thinking this, I trying to, was it Ms. Morris? Anyway, one of 'em did. Older ladies did not like this. And he had to get the money, put take, put the money back. He had to get out of the whole thing. It was, and Norby Robinson, you didn't know him. He was so funny. He was on the board and I told him, he just, he just like a ostrich taking your neck in the grass hole <laugh> because he just, he fought Doc so hard on it. Right. But no, they, they did not do it. It was a big, big blow up in Middleburg Town about John Dean.  
Speaker 0    01:21:30    Right.  
Speaker 1    01:21:31    Yeah. <laugh>. That was one thing that happened when I was on the board. Um, and then I built, I was head of the building committee on the one building that's from the A-frame and it was supposed to be science building. So I was headed of that. And Ellen <inaudible> was with me on that. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So I got that building done. So,  
Speaker 0    01:21:57    Oh, that's the one next where the lower school classes are.  
Speaker 1    01:22:02    Yeah. See, I'm, it's gotten so big now. I don't know. You know where the aframe is?  
Speaker 0    01:22:06    Mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    01:22:07    <affirmative>. Okay. The aframe. And then you're going west from that. Right. There's a sort of a long building that's a 10. Yeah. Right. That's what we did. Yeah. We got that done. Hmm.  
Speaker 0    01:22:19    So that must have, that must've like, put, almost doubled the school.  
Speaker 1    01:22:27    It really helped the upper school as I recall.  
Speaker 0    01:22:30    Right. Because it they move, were able to move over there. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:22:34    It gave them Yeah. With bigger, bigger areas. Right. And um, science was put in up there as I recall.  
Speaker 0    01:22:43    Right. And were people generous to fundraising? Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:22:47    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah. I found it anyway. And I've always found that, uh, people, words, it involves their children. They're, they are very giving. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    01:23:01    Yeah. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Well, you've been quite a pillar in the society, in the community to help with the church and the school and  
Speaker 1    01:23:10    Well, I did it really selfish reasons. It gave me connection to people that I, uh, needed as a village. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:23:20    I mean, we really are a village of friends. I mean, if anybody, you, me, anybody. I get sick. It was Betsy was here the other day and there's a young woman who's being evicted, uh, in Leesburg because she can't pay her rent. She has two children. And they called the church and Betsy got the money her own, paid for it herself and couldn't put it in the post office. 'cause it had to be there by Friday. So she gets in the car and drops it over to Ville. Paid that rent for a month. She doesn't know the woman. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She's just, it's just one of those things that, and that has come up many times in the past, many times at Christmas. Oh, Freddie Spencer, he used to organize all the hams and the food and everything at Christmas. And we'd put the children in the back of pickups and drive through Upperville and drop off food and presents to all the people in the community back in the little olds. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. That was really fun. And Carol, they still, Carol, I have carolers every year.  
Speaker 0    01:24:39    Yeah. That's really fun. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:24:42    So, you know the traditions, some of 'em still go, go on.  
Speaker 0    01:24:46    We used to Carol on horses and I, we haven't done that for a long  
Speaker 1    01:24:49    Time. Oh really? What fun  
Speaker 0    01:24:51    Rectortown has is fun. What fun. And I think some of the little roads, like I remember going trick or treating on Harrington Road and the Fout girls were out trick or treating on their ponies.  
Speaker 1    01:25:04    That's fun.  
Speaker 0    01:25:05    Um, all the, you know, everybody, every little neighborhood has their Yeah. Their,  
Speaker 1    01:25:10    That's very special. Special,  
Speaker 0    01:25:12    Special traditions. See  
Speaker 1    01:25:14    And that's what makes this place so mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    01:25:16    <affirmative>. Do you think it's the small town ness of it?  
Speaker 1    01:25:21    I  
Speaker 0    01:25:22    That we know one another because we're,  
Speaker 1    01:25:24    I I would think yes. I would think yes.  
Speaker 0    01:25:28    Which is interesting 'cause we live pretty far from one another. Yes,  
Speaker 1    01:25:31    We do. But, uh, I don't know. I think it's just, um, the connections. You just wanna hold onto a connection, you know, that. Um, and now that you have this phone thing that you can text and all that sort of stuff, it's sort of eliminating getting in the car and driving over to, you know, to see somebody mm-hmm <affirmative>. Like the older women used to come and visit. You know, that that's part is sort of missed. But we, like yesterday, Helen, we went, she said, let's go and have lunch together. Just, you know, so we do that mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and my other friends do too. But it's something you work on, I think outta necessity, uh, it was done, but originally that people were lonely. Right. I remember a snowstorm, uh, when Billy was a baby and, you know, you don't remember Dennis McCarty, do you?  
Speaker 0    01:26:31    No, but I know the name.  
Speaker 1    01:26:32    Yeah. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And Little Dennis died a couple years ago and he'd jump, but Big Dennis came over to Asure. He was married to one of the PLA girls. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Came to Air. Shere was snowing to beat the band. He was in his pickup. Tommy had his old red pickup, and he came over and said, come over to come over down to De la Pointe to our place and have a hamburger or something like that. Of course we got in the car, the truck, and I had a bag. How are you?  
Speaker 0    01:27:02    Hey, how are you? Good. How are you honey? Good. Nice to see you.  
Speaker 1    01:27:06    I had a bag with a bottle for Billy and a diaper or whatever, you know, just something like that. Well, when we got in there to dump plane, we couldn't get out. And Virginia tore a tea claws to make diapers, <laugh>. Um, we, we just let Billy drink the milk that we had that she had. I mean, it was, and we didn't, we thought it was just grand.  
Speaker 0    01:27:32    We thought it was fun.  
Speaker 1    01:27:33    Spent the night. Yep. We just, it didn't, didn't, didn't foul up anything. It didn't, Tommy didn't miss a day of work. Right. Dentist didn't either. You know, it was just things like that. It was just spur of the moment. Right. He, he, big dentist just showed up, come on over and have a hamburger. Snowing didn't phase him.  
Speaker 0    01:27:55    Now he would text you and you would say,  
Speaker 1    01:27:57    Oh no, I couldn't possibly driving this  
Speaker 0    01:28:00    <laugh>.  
Speaker 1    01:28:01    Yeah. That's, that's, but at least we stay in touch. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I love the place. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    01:28:10    Well it is very different with the communication and  
Speaker 1    01:28:14    Well, it is.  
Speaker 0    01:28:16    Um, you know, but again, it's pro and it's a con, you know, it's a catch 22. Yes. It is. Just like most of,  
Speaker 1    01:28:24    And I do not know, I do not know many of the people when I go to Safeway.  
Speaker 0    01:28:29    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:28:30    Me neither. I just don't know them.  
Speaker 0    01:28:33    Me neither. Now that I don't go to Hill School anymore. I  
Speaker 1    01:28:36    Know. You know, I don't go to either. I, so it's really, um, my only really, um, connection with any new people who I do not know. I spoke to one woman yesterday that I did not know, but Helen did is the club when I go for lunch mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    01:28:54    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:28:55    That's the one place that I can see people. And maybe one out of 30 I can say I'm Mary Stokes. Right. And I did with this young girl yesterday, and Helen knew her. I liked her French fries, <laugh> <laugh>. What kind of french fries do you have and mean cruises. When you get as old as I do, Lydia, you can, you can get away with a lot of things that you didn't get along away with before. Like, can I have one? Try one of your french fries for  
Speaker 0    01:29:25    <laugh> <laugh>. Did you ask her?  
Speaker 1    01:29:27    I was ready to. Helen did. Well I had a sweet potato one yesterday because Courtney, whatever her last name is Right. Um, had sweet  
Speaker 0    01:29:38    Protective. They're good too. They're good too. Your view is so beautiful here,  
Speaker 1    01:29:42    Isn't it? There pretty.  
Speaker 0    01:29:43    It's so beautiful. And  
Speaker 1    01:29:44    I wish you could see it in the sunlight, but, uh, so nice. Those are my cattle protect, not mine. Right. Those are Jerry Crenshaw's cattle. I quit buying steers about 15 years ago.  
Speaker 0    01:29:57    You did? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So you stayed in it mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:29:59    For a while after Tommy died. I  
Speaker 0    01:30:01    And you had them here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:30:04    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. That's how I could figure out that leasing was nicer if it snowed. I didn't have to go out there and spend fix the fence. Right. You know, and of course if there is a problem, Bob and, and Betsy work it out. Well because she has her horses here.  
Speaker 0    01:30:25    Uh, they had, they have Virginia beef running, not where we are now, but behind our old house. And every once in a while, one of 'em would get brave and walk through the little lane there. Yeah. But you know,  
Speaker 1    01:30:42    Well, it's like Sam Fred Road. It's always people. There's always a cow that's gotten out and it's a dark road and you come around a corner <laugh> and you see an Angus and something else is coming this way and it's always on the Facebook or the right uncensored thing, which I don't read very much, but it's always on there. Those Bear 70 ones out or number elevens out.  
Speaker 0    01:31:08    Bear. There has been a bear some  
Speaker 1    01:31:10    Bears  
Speaker 0    01:31:11    Out on, um, between us and where the Wileys are.  
Speaker 1    01:31:16    Um, yeah. There was a picture that Gail sent to me when I was in New Mexico in October. Um, of the mother bear had just gone across our road and the baby bear was fallen. And she sent me a picture. She took a picture. She or May did. So I know they're, I just don't know why I haven't had, had them hanging closer around my bird feeders or I don't know why. Yeah. Because other people with bird feeders have the bears.  
Speaker 0    01:31:48    Yeah. We haven't had, I haven't been as close to our house.  
Speaker 1    01:31:51    Uhuh. And I don't have a dog anymore.  
Speaker 0    01:31:54    I've seen a coyote  
Speaker 1    01:31:55    Have you  
Speaker 0    01:31:56    At the crossing right by the Rectortown post office. I was coming. It was dark and at first I thought it was a dog. But you know, they walk very distinctively. Yeah. And I got home and I said, that's not a dog.  
Speaker 1    01:32:11    That was, I'm very concerned about the, the, the mixed breed that, that he's more aggressive. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, isn't that right? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. He's more aggressive. The ones that have bred with the  
Speaker 0    01:32:23    Right.  
Speaker 1    01:32:25    I'm concerned about that.  
Speaker 0    01:32:25    And they're, they steal dogs. Yes. They lure them in and then they take them.  
Speaker 1    01:32:32    Um, I read about the men that was on a walk with his family the other day and uh, it must have been a rabid, tardy wolf. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And grabbed his 3-year-old son's jacket to take him. And that's when he jumped in and the father strangled the animal to death. Then they all have to go through rabies shots and all that. 'cause they think he's rab He probably was. Of course.  
Speaker 0    01:33:00    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    01:33:01    And he be his wife and he had attacked another couple mm-hmm <affirmative>. Day before or something. That's pretty scary.  
Speaker 0    01:33:10    Did you have any big threats with cattle? And in the time, were there any diseases or predators? We  
Speaker 1    01:33:17    Had wild dogs at one point. You did? And, um, they came through Asure and I think I was in the hospital. John Hopkins was when my surgery, 'cause my sister was here, uh, Asure. And uh, she chased him away. They came after the sheep. We had sheep. Right. And, um, you know, they get sheep over on his back. He'll just lay there and let him kill him. And, um, sheep ran him off  
Speaker 0    01:33:45    And they didn't get anything. And  
Speaker 1    01:33:46    They didn't, not that I remember. Right. But we used to have trouble, A lot of trouble with, you know, dogs that would just Yeah. Wild dogs. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. We called them wild dogs and they would go in through the trash in Upperville a lot. And I don't know how they stopped it, but Right. In town. I don't know whether they shot 'em or they captured them or what they did. Right. But that's the only thing that I remember.  
Speaker 0    01:34:13    So when I first moved to Upperville was when, shortly after I moved to Upperville was when they were, Sandy Lerner was trying to start the restaurant there in town, Uhhuh. And there was a big mess about that.  
Speaker 1    01:34:30    Yeah. She was gonna tear it down. They didn't approve the, and that's v Keer County. And she got it through. She won it over.  
Speaker 0    01:34:41    But the, I mean, she had a lot of controversy around her, right? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. She closed the,  
Speaker 1    01:34:47    The  
Speaker 0    01:34:47    Hunt land to the hunt.  
Speaker 1    01:34:49    That was the first thing she  
Speaker 0    01:34:50    Did. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    01:34:52    I said, I said to Tommy, Tommy was president of the Mont Hunt. I said, personally, she doesn't like men. So I don't think you have a prayer <laugh>. I don't think so. He was sick anyway, but you know, he had hoped that he could talk it through mm-hmm <affirmative>. She really didn't like the men. She like some more water.  
Speaker 0    01:35:14    No, I'm good. Thank you. Yeah. She opened the, I haven't really seen her since she opened the place in Marshall, but I know that the other operation, I think it's Veal.  
Speaker 1    01:35:26    Veal. Well at least in not shooting off the shotgun over here lately, they'll probably start it in in the spring to keep the birds away from the turkeys and all. And then it goes off and at night you're trying to go to sleep and boom. So everybody calls, we all call Gail calls. I call, would you please not fire that off while we're going to sleep? And then we used to say, I have a new baby and you can't sleep <laugh>. I leave a message there. Or my great-great aunt is 150 and she can't go to sleep. <laugh> and I, there was not much liberty over there. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    01:36:13    Well, it's different, I think when it's a corporation versus a family that, you know, and you can speak to them.  
Speaker 1    01:36:22    And I'll tell you, these men around here did it a lot. They did. They would pick up that phone and they would call and get themselves in trouble or get that person they were talking to in trouble. They would do, it was a game. They were jokesters.  
Speaker 0    01:36:41    I think we've lost that a little bit. We have, everybody's so sensitive about everything.  
Speaker 1    01:36:44    I know. Yes. We have lost that. You could get away with a lot of things that were a lot more fun, you know, and not have repercussions. Well takes, I shouldn't even told you that story.  
Speaker 0    01:36:57    Every, everybody takes everything. So personally I know,  
Speaker 1    01:37:00    I know.  
Speaker 0    01:37:01    It's, it's hard to, you know, then you worry, oh, did I say  
Speaker 1    01:37:06    I know what somebody asked me the other day about somebody that was sick. And I said, I can't answer that because I don't know. Because it used to be when you were really good friends, you'd say, well, I'm worried about it. 'cause I think this, and then that person would be able to take 'em to custards or something that right now you just, you just don't get involved with your opinion. Yeah. You just don't.  
Speaker 0    01:37:35    It's too bad we're losing, uh, authenticity.  
Speaker 1    01:37:38    That's right. And communication is very important. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. It really is. And don't be, you know, don't be afraid. And we're all so afraid  
Speaker 0    01:37:53    Yeah. To state your opinion. Yeah,  
Speaker 1    01:37:57    Very much so.  
Speaker 0    01:37:58    Well, it's hard because you get, you feel judged on your opinion as opposed to it's a different opinion from mine. So I appreciate that you  
Speaker 1    01:38:10    Did you by any chance? You're too young. But they had the thing on Jim Lara last night.

Speaker 1    01:38:21    A journalist  
Speaker 0    01:38:22    Was that on PBS  
Speaker 1    01:38:24    Uhhuh. <affirmative>. What a, oh, that it was, he had his, um, McNeil and then, um, a woman and an, and, um, a judge who was his best friend, but their comments about him were so poignant. But he could speak the journalist talk mm-hmm <affirmative>. Without driving a wedge between people. Right. He, he, he made them think, you know, I, I'm not better than you. He said, I just want learn. Right.  
Speaker 0    01:39:08    I just want  
Speaker 1    01:39:09    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Tell me, explain to me then, you know, and what do, what do you mean by that? You know, to show that he wasn't above, he could communicate. Right. It was really well done last. My mother was crazy about Jim Lair.

Speaker 1    01:39:31    Yeah. Right. That's what I thought. It's a rainy day tomorrow. You can do it tomorrow.  
Speaker 0    01:39:36    That's right. I can do it  
Speaker 1    01:39:37    Tomorrow on a rainy day.  
Speaker 0    01:39:39    Well, I can't thank you enough for giving me so much of your time. Well,  
Speaker 1    01:39:43    I hope I haven't embarrassed myself.  
Speaker 0    01:39:45    No, I'm sure you have not.  
Speaker 1    01:39:47    I enjoyed talking with you.  
Speaker 0    01:39:48    Well, you were worried you had nothing to say, but I feel like I could stay here five hours and you have such a rich life. And so  
Speaker 1    01:39:57    Well, we'll just have lunch one day. I would love to do that. And then we'd just keep talking. Just communicating.  
Speaker 0    01:40:02    That would be great.  
Speaker 1    01:40:03    That would be great.
