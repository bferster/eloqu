Speaker 0    00:24:29    He took care of the Yeah. Whatever they needed.

Speaker 1    00:24:40    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:24:41    Had he grown up with horses?  
Speaker 1    00:24:43    Huh?  
Speaker 0    00:24:44    Did he grow up with horses?  
Speaker 1    00:24:46    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:24:48    So that was,  
Speaker 1    00:24:49    And he was very good. <laugh>. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:24:52    And did he work for certain people, or when you worked at the track, he worked for owners, didn't you?  
Speaker 1    00:25:00    Yeah. Then, you know, like, uh, uh, ley White, do you know him? And anyway, he has a farm down there. He would work, come back and work on the farm with the horses, you know?  
Speaker 0    00:25:18    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And he had done that in Leesburg as well. Work with horses?  
Speaker 1    00:25:24    No, the, um, there's no farms, right? In Leesburg. <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:25:30    Oh. He grew up in  
Speaker 1    00:25:31    Leeburg, but I think he lived in the country. But it was Leesburg address,  
Speaker 0    00:25:37    Right? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Right. I don't think Leesburg was the way it is now. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:25:42    Probably at  
Speaker 0    00:25:44    That point. And his family was still in Leesburg when you married?  
Speaker 1    00:25:49    They, yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:25:50    And did you see much of them? Did you visit back and forth?  
Speaker 1    00:25:54    We visited some, but you know, not, not really that much. Right. But his family moved all around. You know, some of 'em lived in Washington and, uh, Leesburg and, um, uh, different places. 'cause he, he came from a big family too. And then, you know, his mother, father died, you know, his father died young when he was real young, died. I think they said when the flu was going around, or some cases, bad cases of flu. His father died. And, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:26:37    Was he the same age as you, Charlie?  
Speaker 1    00:26:41    No. He, he was young. And he, he, you know, you know, in those times, if, uh, if your sister didn't have children, they would help you to raise you.  
Speaker 0    00:26:56    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:26:59    So that's what they did. So  
Speaker 0    00:27:01    They grew up with just one  
Speaker 1    00:27:02    Big family, all taking care of each other. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:27:05    <affirmative>. What year was he born?    
Speaker 1    00:27:12    In 19, I think He was 
Speaker 1    00:27:16    I think it's 1960, because he's 10 years older than I,  
Speaker 0    00:27:22    1960.  
Speaker 1    00:27:23    I think that's, if I can't remember <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:27:29    So he was older than you at the time?    
Speaker 0    00:27:37    And did you build the house next door?  
Speaker 1    00:27:43    Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We, we were just young kid, <laugh> young, you know, just 18. We just rented the house. Oh, you  
Speaker 0    00:27:53    Rented  
Speaker 1    00:27:53    The house? We rented.  
Speaker 1    00:28:02    We moved, um, then I, we, we moved on at, uh, Canfield. I don't know where, you know, where Canfield.  
Speaker 0    00:28:12    Oh, where's that?  
Speaker 1    00:28:13    That's, um, it's right up the road, about half a mile. And then it turned about, you know, it's not very far. And we moved, could work for Jordan. Bentley. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. <inaudible>. And worked on the farm, you know, and had a house and everything, <laugh>. And that's where, uh, we kind of stayed more or less until the children, you know, grew up and went out on the own. The different people bought the house. And, but we just, I just stayed with them, you know, different people. And, um, and then, then I, um, when I did work, I worked for, I would always, as a child, I was always attracted to well,  
Speaker 1    00:29:17    Yeah. And, because there was a lady that had worked at, well, and she had a little girl, and I would go down and babysit, you know, that child. I was always attracted to Welbourne.  
Speaker 1    00:29:33    And I think probably when I was still living here, Welbourne was my first job.  
Speaker 0    00:29:41    And when you babysat there?  
Speaker 1    00:29:44    No, it wasn't at, at Weldon. It's a big house. It was my first job when I got old enough to work,  
Speaker 0    00:29:51    Was working down there. Mm-hmm. And what did you do at Weldon?  
Speaker 1    00:29:55    Oh, I, I, I worked, uh, at Saturday Table and had the bed. I worked as a maid. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:30:04    It's a beautiful place for mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 1    00:30:08    And then, then even though I would, uh, off and on, I would always go when they needed somebody. Well, and I would, you know, go to well, and then when they finally sold the Penfield the last time, and I decided to not to stay. And so I, this house, so we didn't own this house, you know, we rented it. Right. So when the, this house came up for sale, my sisters, by that time, they, my sister was, my parents was passed on, and my sister was building a house in San Louis, and she didn't want it. And then my other sister's building house later in San Louis, and she didn't want it. My brother built a house in San <laugh>, and so I bought this house.  
Speaker 0    00:31:14    And when was that?  
Speaker 1    00:31:15    That was in, I'm not good with the dates. It seems about 20 something years ago. I mean, I got it down on paper, but

Speaker 0    00:39:24    Living. You look so beautiful and young. I would  
Speaker 1    00:39:29    <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:39:31    Love to know your aging secret,  
Speaker 1    00:39:34    <laugh>.  
Speaker 0    00:39:37    Do you, um, remember when you were growing up, the, were there attitudes here about segregation? Did you feel safe here in this  
Speaker 1    00:39:53    Community? Oh, yeah. We, we were, we were well safe. Yeah. We, we, uh, we really didn't know. We didn't feel the segregation. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:40:05    But there were like store places, eating places in Middleburg, because we, we weren't, you know, we, we didn't go out to eat or anything, but if you did, you'd have to go in the back doors and things like that. But, uh, we, we, we didn't feel that, uh, well, I guess we did have it, you know, like the white kid rode the bus and we walked, uh, there was one or two people that around here, you know, you went to the house and, but they, uh, it was where my father worked on here. We went to the house. 'cause she sold chickens and eggs, and we had to go get our milk with, and we would be called, she wouldn't let us in the house and things like that. But, you know, their parents never let us disrespect them. We were, you know. But, um, later on in life, you know, that she apologized, you know, she said, you know, she said, you know, sickness will bring you down, <laugh>. And we met on the street in Mul later on in life. And, uh, but, uh, we weren't taught to disrespect people because your parents had to work for 'em.  
Speaker 0    00:41:48    Right.  
Speaker 1    00:41:50    But they, we, I don't think we were mistreated that badly, you know?  
Speaker 0    00:41:57    And  
Speaker 1    00:41:58    This, we got May got paid less than any, any, you know, the white people.  
Speaker 0    00:42:07    But living here, was it comfortable living? Was it hard?  
Speaker 1    00:42:16    Well, when you look back on it and see that, that I can walk and turn it, stick it on and get water, we had to carry water, you know, and we had to put wood in the stove, you know, car. So it, it was hard, but it was a way of life. And it's just what you did. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. You know,  
Speaker 0    00:42:38    You didn't have water here for some time, did you?  
Speaker 1    00:42:41    No, we didn't have water in the bathroom. You know, we'd go outside to the bathroom and, um, we didn't have no water here.  
Speaker 0    00:42:52    Where did the water come from?  
Speaker 1    00:42:54    Well, I, I've got a, well now mm-hmm <affirmative>. Everybody has a well,  
Speaker 0    00:42:59    But in the past, you didn't have a, well,  
Speaker 1    00:43:02    Well, we had a system right here, Uhhuh. <affirmative>. And, and that's where we got. And, um, but other people, uh, had decent drinking water, and you would just go cross road and get a bucket of water, <laugh> to drink. And, um, but to wash, and you had to bring you wash water and, um, do all of that kind of stuff. It was hard living. But as was way of life. You didn't realize how hard it was  
Speaker 0    00:43:35    Right now that you can turn on your water.  
Speaker 1    00:43:38    Yeah. You just turn on the water and take a shower. I thank God every time I take a shower. <laugh>,  
Speaker 0    00:43:45    When did the plumbing come in to Willisville?  
Speaker 1    00:43:51    Um, I, I guess it about, about the time I bought my house, you know? So it wasn't even been here that long,  
Speaker 0    00:44:05    Right?  
Speaker 1    00:44:05    Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 0    00:44:07    And until then, you had an outhouse?  
Speaker 1    00:44:13    Um, I had an outside bathroom. Yeah. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. But by that time, you, you, you, you had Don Yard, <laugh>. So that's what I had done yet.  
Speaker 0    00:44:38    I'll look up on the, when they brought water here. That was a, a county,  
Speaker 1    00:44:44    Huh?  
Speaker 0    00:44:45    That was the county, right? Yeah. The county had to
